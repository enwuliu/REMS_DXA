JOUR,a comparison between ibex bone health applied to digital radiographs and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at the distal-third and ultra-distal regions of the radius, to read,10.1186/s12891-024-07670-0,"['Lopez, Ben', 'Meertens, Robert', 'Gundry, Mike', 'Scott, Paul', 'Crone, Mr Ben', 'McWilliam, Richard']",2024,"BACKGROUND: In an ageing population, low impact fragility fractures are becoming increasingly common. However, fracture risk can be reduced where low bone density can be identified at an early stage. In this study we aim to demonstrate that IBEX Bone Health (IBEX BH) can provide a clinically useful prediction from wrist radiographs of aBMD and T-score at the ultra-distal (UD) and distal-third (DT) regions of the radius., METHODS: A 261-participant single-centre, non-randomised, prospective, study was carried out to compare a) IBEX BH, a quantitative digital radiography software device, to b) Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). A total of 257 participants with wrist digital radiograph (DR), forearm DXA pairs were included in the analysis after exclusions., RESULTS: The adjusted R2 value for IBEX BH outputs to the radial areal bone mineral density (aBMD) produced by a GE Lunar DXA system for the UD region is 0.87 (99% Confidence Interval (CI) [0.84, 0.89]). The adjusted R2 value for IBEX BH outputs to aBMD for the DT region is 0.88 (99% CI [0.85, 0.90]). The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) for the forearm T-score <= - 2.5 risk prediction model at the UD region is 0.95 (99% CI [0.93, 0.98]). The AUC for the forearm T-score <= - 2.5 risk prediction model at the DT region is 0.98 (99% CI [0.97, 0.99])., CONCLUSION: From a DR of the wrist, IBEX BH provides a clinically useful i) estimate of aBMD at the two regions of interest on the radius and ii) risk prediction model of forearm T-score <= - 2.5 at the UD and DT regions.

The best cut-off value of FS = 37.2 was considered in this paper [1]. Objectives: The aim of the current study is to investigate the multivariate significant risk factors for FS? 37.2. Methods: In our study, REMS assessments of 252 women with mean age 60 years (yrs.) ± 13 yrs. (range 35-81 yrs.) were conducted. We set up two groups according to the FS of the lumbar spine of the subjects: 1st group with FS ? 37.2 and 2nd group with FS <37.2. Age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), menopausal status, history of previous fractures, diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), use of corticosteroids (CS), current smoking and alcohol consumption of three or more drinks daily were the risk factors included in the multivariate statistical analysis. We analyzed the significant risk factors for FS ? 37.2 with binary logistic regression. The data collection and transfer from the electronic health record was performed with an innovative JAVA tool, developed by Kirilov et al. [2,3]. Results: Of total 252 women the mean weight was of 65.6 kg. ± 14.1 kg. (range 41-117 kg.), mean height 158.2 cm. ± 8.5 cm. (range 132-179 cm.) and mean BMI 27.2 kg/cm2 ± 5.5 kg/cm2 (range 14.1-46.6 kg/cm2). 227 women (90.1%) were attributed to postmenopausal. Age (p<0.001), menopause (p=0.006), history of previous fractures (p<0.001), diagnosis of RA (p=0.003) and use of CS (p=0.002) were the multivariate significant risk factors for FS ? 37.2. Odds ratio (OR) for the risk factor age was 1.3, so each added year of the women’s age increased the risk for FS ? 37.2 by 1.3%. The risk factor menopause showed OR of 7.24, so postmenopausal women had about 7.2 times higher risk of FS ? 37.2 compared to women who still have their menstruation. Subjects with previous fractures had 15.3 times higher risk for FS ? 37.2 than non-fractured subjects. ORs were 2.16 for RA and 3.24 for the use of CS, so women with RA had 2.2 times highe",Scie

The innovative method Radiofrequency echographic multispectrometry (REMS) has the opportunity to assess not only the bone quantity by analyzing the bone mineral density but also the bone quality through the evaluation of the fragility score (FS) [1]. Bone quality is closely associated with higher fracture risk. Objectives: The aim of our study is to assess the hip fragility score with REMS of fractured and non-fractured women. Methods: The FS of the hip of 65 women was assessed with REMS. Age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density (BMD), T-score, Z-score and FS were compared between the fractured and non-fractured women using independent sample T-test. Data collection and transfer from the electronic health record was performed with an innovative JAVA tool, developed by Kirilov et al. [2,3]. Results: Subjects had average age of 62 years (yr.) with range 56-81 yr. 15 women (32.1%) reported a previous fracture. Fractured subjects were significantly older (mean age of 81 yr.) than non-fractured subjects (mean age of 56 yr.), p<0.001. Height didn’t differ significantly between the both groups. Fractured women had significantly lower weight and BMI compared to non-fractured group, p<0.001. Fractured subjects had also lower hip BMD (0.518 g/cm2), lower T-score (-2.9 SD) and Z-score (-0.7 SD) of the hip and higher hip fragility score (71.1) compared to non-fractured subjects (BMD=0.742 g/cm2, T-score= -1.0 SD, Z-score=-0.3 SD and FS=25.7), p<0.001. Conclusion: Fractured women demonstrated higher fragility score than non-fractured women. These results showed the good ability of the REMS based fragility score to select subjects with deteriorated bone microarchitecture. REFERENCES: [1] Al Refaie A, Baldassini L, Mondillo C, et al.

It is a common condition in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because it causes a decrease in lean mass that may result in physical disability, weakness, infections, and even premature death. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is used to measure muscle mass. European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2) recommends the SARC-F, a tool that measures the risk of sarcopenia. A SARC-F study in rheumatic patients with sarcopenia detected sarcopenia risk in only 40% of the patients. Objectives: To compare the sarcopenia risk frequency by SARC-F and the sarcopenia detection by DEXA in high to intermediate fracture risk RA patient. Methods: A transversal and descriptive study included patients from our clinic in a University Hospital in Monterrey, Mexico diagnosed with RA according to ACR/EULAR criteria. The DEXA scan was used to diagnose sarcopenia based on muscle mass percentage. Sarcopenia was identified with the EWGSOP2 criteria with a muscle mass percentage of ?7.0 kg/m2 in men and ?5.5 kg/m2 in women. The SARC-F tool considers a score of >4 as a high risk of sarcopenia. Shapiro-Wilk to determine normality and T-student test for compare groups were performed. Data were presented as percent frequency, mean ± standard deviation (SD), or median and interquartile range (IQR). Spearman correlation test was performed. A p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS v.25. Results: A total of 32 patients diagnosed with RA were included, 30 (93.8%) were women and 2 (4.3%) were men. The mean age of patients was 65 ± 9.81. Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics. We found that 12 (37.5%) patients have sarcopenia with a mean muscle mass percentage of 5.92 ± 1.01. Risk of sarcopenia with SARC-F was identified in 18 (56.3%), with a mean of 4.16 ± 2.73. We compared the sarcopenia-risk patients with those who had already developed sarcopenia. There was no statistically significant difference between the two methods (p=0.147).

Radiofrequency echographic multispectrometry (REMS) is an innovative non-ionizing technology that evaluates bone mineral density by analysing raw unfiltered native ultrasound signals. Its daily clinical use is still limited though and further data is required in order to sustain its accuracy. Objectives: The study aimed to explore the prevalence of reduced bone mineral density (BMD) measured with REMS technology and the potential risks for osteopenia and osteoporosis in a Romanian patients sample. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study design was carried out. For this study, forty patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis were recruited and further accepted for demographic data collection, the body mass index (BMI), disease evolution, blood and BMD tests (T score, fragility score (FS), the risk of major osteoporotic fracture in 5 years (MOF5y) for lumbar spine and femoral neck). Disease activity score at 28 joints (DAS28) and health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) were recorded. Chi-square, Pearson correlations, independent t test were calculated using IBM SPSS software. Risk factors for bone loss were analyzed by logistic regression. Results: Forty patients were included in the study: 38 females (30 post-menopausal) and 2 men, with the mean age 56.97±13.48 years, mean BMI 26.4±5.1 kg/m2 and mean disease length 11.32±10.97 years. Twenty two were undergoing corticotherapy. Eight patients (20%) had a score of osteoporosis (T score<-2.5) in at least one measured site and 22 (55%) patients had a score of osteopenia (-2.5<T score<-1), respectively. 82.5% of the subjects were taking at least one conventional syntetic disease modifying antirheumatic drug (csDMARDs) and 35% a biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs). A multiple linear regression analysis showed that the age and BMI are risk factors for BMD changes in the spine (F=65.45, p = <.001, R2 = 0.78) and the hip (F=19.08, p = <.001, R2 = 0.92.)

During the post renal-transplant period, a significant loss in bone strength, characterized by high rates of osteopenia and osteoporosis occurs with consequent higher susceptibility to fracture. The clinical management of bone diseases in transplant patients is complex due to both, the frequent persistence of Chronic Renal Disease (CKD) and the normal aging process, leading to a continuous need for regular bone status monitoring. Objectives: The aim of the present study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the non-ionizing method, Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS) for the detection of impaired bone status of kidney transplant recipients (KTR) fractured and non-fractured in comparison to conventional dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Methods: A cohort of 39 male and women Caucasian patients undergoing kidney transplantation was enrolled in the study. All enrolled patients underwent a lumbar spine (LS) examination both with REMS and with DXA. Because of renal impairment, KTR patients experience substantial bone loss which is associated to a reduced T-score and consequent susceptibility to fragility fractures. On the basis of the history of fragility fractures collected from each participant, the cohort was stratified into two groups, fractured and non-fractured patients, and the bone health status was evaluated using both techniques. From a total of 39 lumbar scans, 9 and 30 scans encompassed patients with and without a fracture history, respectively. Results: As expected, the fractured group yielded a lower spinal T-score values compared to the non-fractured ones with both REMS and DXA techniques (Table 1). The measurements differed significantly between the two technologies. In particular, considering the whole cohort of fractured and non-fractured patients, the mean BMD at the lumbar spine obtained with REMS was 0.866 ± 0.104 g/cm2, which was significantly lower than the corresponding DXA ones (0.929 ± 0.191 g/cm2; p<0.05).

This can be mainly explained by the chronic state of inflammation as well as corticosteroid use. According to some authors, there may be a connection between systemic and alveolar bone loss [1]. However, the relationship between osteoporosis and alveolar bone loss is not completely elucidated. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between bone mineral density and the presence of oral-dental anomalies in RA patients. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study involving patients with RA recruited from the rheumatology department of Mongi Slim Hospital. Sociodemographic data as well as those related to RA were transcribed (duration, joint deformities, extra-articular manifestations (EAM), immunological status, co-morbidities, treatment modalities, and disease activity assessed by the DAS28 (ESR) scores.). A dental consultation was provided to all patients. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) expressed in T-score and g/cm2. Osteoporosis was defined as a T-score ? -2.5. A significance threshold was set at p<0.05. Results: A total of 50 patients (43 women (86%) and 7 men (14%)) were included in the study. The mean age was 56 (10) years [30-75]. The mean disease duration was 9 (6) years [1-23].

The principle of the REMS technology is based on the analysis of native raw unfiltered ultrasound signals during an echographic scan of the lumbar spine or the femoral neck [1]. Several studies demonstrated the high concordance with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in terms of measured BMD with this novel technology [2,3]. In previous published literature it was envisaged to apply this technology for the examination of the axial bone density in pregnant women. Pregnancy-associated bone loss has been demonstrated as decreased bone mineral density (BMD) in previous studies [4]. Objectives: The aim of the current study is to compare the BMD values of both femora between pregnant and non-pregnant women matched for age and BMI using the novel REMS technology. Methods: Of total fifty women twenty pregnant women (40%) and thirty non-pregnant women (60%) were included in the study. The mean age of the pregnant women was 32 years ± 5 standard deviations (SD), (range 25-41 years) and the mean age of the non-pregnant women was 30 years ± 6 standard deviations (SD), (range 24-39 years). REMS approach was used to assess REMS-based BMD and REMS-based Z-score values of the femoral neck. Furthermore, body mass index (BMI) and gestational age in weeks were evaluated. Results: The mean BMI of the pregnant women was 26 kg/m2 ± 7 kg/m2 (range 14 kg/m2-42 kg/m2) and those of the non-pregnant women was 25 kg/m2 ± 5 kg/m2 (range 16 kg/m2-35 kg/m2). The mean gestational age was 20 weeks' gestation ± 5 weeks' gestation (range 13-27 weeks' gestation). REMS-based mean BMD of the left femoral neck of the pregnant women was 0.793 g/cm2 ± 0.167 g/cm2 (range 0.563 g/cm2-1.154 g/cm2).

Controversy exists regarding diagnostics and the role of parathyroidectomy in such cases. A chief reason for lack of consensus is the disagreement among experts regarding the potential complications and a bias towards perhaps benign nature of this condition. Objectives: In order to understand the challenges posed by this cohort, we aim to characterise these patients at presentation to our metabolic bone diseases unit with a focus on bone health. Methods: We interrogated our departmental database and undertook retrospective analysis of all patients presenting to metabolic bone service at our large university teaching hospital with a catchment population of 350,000. Individuals were included in the survey based on criteria of Vit D >70 nmol/L, normal calcium (2.20-2.60 mmol/L), eGFR>60ml/min and PTH >6.9 pmol/L measured twice at least three months apart. Results: Over six months review period, of 134 referrals, 42 (31%) were identified with nHPT. Follow up duration was two years. Mean age was 60 years (25-86). 38 (90%) were women with 31 (81%) post menopause. 34 (80%) were of Caucasian descent. All had comorbidities with median of five (1-14). Polypharmacy (>4 prescribed medicines) was common (36/42, 85%) with mean of seven prescribed medications (0-22). Mean Vit D was 88 (70.4-133.6), calcium 2.43 (2.26-2.58), creatinine 69.8 (48-115) and PTH 8.8 (7.2-14.2).

Results Patients with RA were significantly younger (69.3 ± 6.5 years) than those without RA (76.4 ± 5.0 years) (p = 0.002). BMI values did not differ significantly between the two groups (25.76 ± 4.82 kg/m2 for patients with RA and 27.57 ± 5.37 kg/m2 for patients without RA). Patients with and without RA did not show any significantly differences between BMDus values of L1-L4 (0.629/0.607 g/cm2 for L1, 0.692/0.688 g/cm2 for L2, 0.761/0.743 g/cm2 for L3 and 0.789/0.769 g/cm2 for L4). Patients with RA had higher total lumbar spine T-score (-2.6 ± 0.8 standard deviations) compared to those without RA (-3.1 ± 0.5 standard deviations), but this difference was not significant (p > 0.05). Femoral neck BMDus, trochanteric BMDus and total hip BMDus were similar in the groups with and without RA (0.550/0.548 g/cm2 for femoral neck, 0.710/0.693 g/cm2 for trochanter, 0.688/0.678 g/cm2 for total hip).

Age, concomitant diseases, body mass index (BMI), body composition, etc. are important risk factors that could reflect on bone density and on the increased risk of fractures. Although obesity has been associated with increased bone mineral density (BMD) in the most studies, the relationship between body fat and BMD remains contradictive. Objectives The aim of this study is to determine if there is any association between body fat distribution and bone mineral density in postmenopausal women through novel ultrasound technique applicable on both-lumbar spine and femoral neck. Methods A total of 98 women with mean age 62 ± 11 years underwent radiofrequency echographic multi spectrometry (REMS). Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) software was used to assess body fat percentage. Patients were divided into two groups-with body fat ? 32% and body fat < 32%. Age, BMI, lumbar spine BMD, total hip BMD and fracture risk score (FRAX) were compared between the patients with normal body fat and those with high body fat. Results The mean age of the women with normal body fat was 61.1±14.6 years and the mean age of the women with high body fat was 63.3±9.5 years. BMI of the women with body fat < 32% was significantly lower (22.5 kg/cm2) compared to the BMI of the women with body fat ? 32% (30.2 kg/cm2) (p = 0.000). Bone mineral density of L1-L4 and total lumbar spine BMD did not differ between the women with normal body fat and high body fat. Femoral neck BMD, trochanteric BMD and total hip BMD of the patients with normal body fat (0.604 g/cm2, 0.737 g/cm2 and 0.736 g/cm2 respectively) were significantly lower than those patients with high body fat (0.682 g/cm2, 0.864 g/cm2 and 0.838 g/cm2 respectively) (p = 0.000 for femoral neck BMD and trochanteric BMD, and p = 0.001 for total hip BMD).

Objectives Aims are: (1) to characterize patients who had DEXA in a university department of rheumatology to study its diagnostic efficacy; (2) to look after risk factors specific to our population; (3) to evaluate the efficiency of a non-systematic and opportunistic intra-hospital OP screening by comparing results for ambulatory and hospitalized patients in the different departments of the hospital. Methods From 2007 to 2012, 6406 initial DEXA from consecutive patients were prospectively encoded (1494 in 2007, 1158 in 2008, 1079 in 2009, 945 in 2010, 868 in 2011 and 862 in 2012) (identical DEXA). Results Cohort characteristics are the following: women 74.4%, mean age (± 1 standard deviation) 60.5 years (± 14.3), mean BMI 25.1 (± 5.1), history of corticotherapy in 30.5%, previous fracture in 29% and current hospitalization in 28.8% of cases. OP (at one of the 3 sites) was diagnosed in 22.3%, a stable value over the years, with, as a repartition, lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip OP in 13.7%, 13.6% and 9.2% respectively. In 3.9%, OP was diagnosed at all the 3 sites. In univariate analysis, OP risk factors were age, history of fracture and low BMI (for all 3 sites), corticotherapy (lumbar spine and femoral neck) and male gender (lumbar spine). In multivariate analysis, regardless of site, age, fracture history, low BMI, and male gender increased the OP risk. Intra-hospital screening identified OP (at any of the 3 sites) in 31.8% (vs 18.5%, p<0.001 for ambulatory screening) and OP at 3 sites simultaneously in 7.9% (vs 2.3%, p <0.0001).

It has been reported in several studies, an incidence of fracture between 30-40% in this population. Objectives To evaluate the evolution of bone turnover biomarkers before and after treatment (according to 2015 NOF guidelines) and to describe the incidence of fracture after a SCI. Methods A prospective study was conducted, including 48 SCI patients followed during an observation period of 24 months, with visits every six months. Thirty two patients concluded the study. In each visit patients were enquired about fractures. A blood test was also performed. In addition a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and simple x-ray of hip and spine was requested annually. Patients were also educated in lifestyle measures, such as an adequate calcium and vitamin D dietary intake. Oral supplementation was initiated in cases of low intake or deficit, respectively. In patients with bone mineral density (BMD) measured by DEXA in range of Osteoporosis, pharmacological therapy was initiated (bisphosphonate or Denosumab). Statistics had been performed with mixed linear regression models. Results Our sample was 56.25% men with an average age of 56.08 ± 13.82 years old. In 32 patients (68.09%) low Vitamin D levels were detected. At baseline in 12 cases (25%) DEXA showed a BMD in osteoporosis range; in 12 (25%) osteopenia, plus 6 fractures (2.6 fractures per 100 years/patient).

Objectives Since PTH has a limited period of approved use, a short term (6 months) use of PTH in combination with Dmab followed by continued use of Dmab may show a sustained synergistic effect of the combination. Methods The BMD trends from real time data from a central dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at our centre in India was studied retrospectively to see if the effect was sustained. Women with postmenopausal osteoporosis who were treated with a combination of Dmab 60 mg via subcutaneous injection (sc) at 6 monthly interval along with PTH 20 mcg sc daily for the first 6 months (Combo), followed by Dmab alone for the next six months were inculded in the study group. Average BMD at L2, L3 and L4 (sp BMD), and Right and Left Hip (hip BMD) were studied from before treatment (a BMD), after the Combo treatment (b BMD) and after 6 months of the second injection of Dmab (c BMD). The mean percentage trend change between a-b BMD and b-c BMD were evaluated. Out of the patients treated with the protocol, 25 were randomly chosen for the retrospective analysis. The least significant change (LSC) 2 from a single centre DXA was used to validate the findings. Results The percentage change after the treatment for 6 months with the Combo was found to be 5.22% in the Spine (LSC= 2.6%)2 and 4.13% in the hip (LSC=3.6%)2. The trend after use of Dmab alone was 5.39% in the spine and 2.93% in the hip showing sustained synergistic effect of the Combo for at least 6 months with the use of Dmab alone.

In March 2019, ROMO was approved for use in Japan for treating severe OP in clinical practice, causing an increase in its prescription in our institute. Although efficacy data for ROMO have been presented in clinical trials, there is a lack of real-world data. In our experience, ROMO treatment results in significant bone mineral density (BMD) gain in some patients, but not all. Therefore, understanding the predictors that enhance the efficacy of ROMO treatments to achieve BMD gain is essential. Objectives This study investigated the efficacy of a 12-month ROMO treatment in patients with OP and explored the efficacy predictors of increased BMD. Methods Our study included 52 patients with OP, who were started on ROMO treatment between June 2019 and August 2020. The following information was collected: 1) baseline characteristics, 2) time-course of BMD (lumbar spine [LS] and total hip [TH]) and bone turnover markers (BTM; bone-specific alkaline phosphatase [BAP], type I procollagen-N-propeptide [P1NP], type I procollagen-N-propeptide[NTX], and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b [TRACP-5b]), 3) multiple regression analysis results following Spearman's correlation analysis of increased BMD values (%) at 12 months and BL characteristics, including BTM change (%) at one month, to investigate the efficacy predictors of ROMO. Results 1) The mean age of the participants was 72.9 years (48 female and four male). Of the 52 understudied patients, 78.8% had past insufficiency fractures, whereas 21.2% had been treated with concomitant prednisolone. Furthermore, 21 patients had primary OP, 20 had rheumatoid arthritis, nine had glucocorticoid-induced OP, and two had other conditions. Pretreatments for OP were bisphosphonate (33 patients), vitamin D (6), none (5), selective estrogen receptor modulator (4), and denosumab (3). 2) Both mean LS- and TH-BMD significantly increased in the patients for whom ROMO administration was continued for 12 months.

By this age, men reach an increased bone mass that starts declining in their fifties, however less rapidly than women after menopause. However, men and women lose bone mass at the same rate by age 65-70, becoming fragile and more likely to have fracture. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy in osteoporosis diagnosis of Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS) technology applied on the proximal femur in an adult male population in comparison with the Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). Methods A cohort of Caucasian males was enrolled in the study. Inclusion criteria were: age between 30 and 90 years, body mass index (BMI) less than 40 kg/m2, no significant walking impairments and proximal femur DXA medical prescription. All the enrolled patients underwent proximal femur scans with both DXA and REMS. The agreement between REMS and DXA-measured BMD was expressed by Pearson correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman method. The classification into patients “with osteoporosis” or “without osteoporosis” was carried out considering the conventional threshold of T-score (-2.5) for both techniques independently. The accuracy was evaluated by the assessment of sensitivity and specificity considering the DXA outcome as reference [1]. Results A total of 219 men were included in the analysis, with mean age of 55.5 (± 15.3) years. The Pearson correlation coefficient between REMS- and DXA-measured BMD values was r=0.94. At Bland-Altman analysis, Bias ± 1.96 Standard Deviation were -0.004 ± 0.04 g/cm2. The REMS capability to discriminate osteoporotic patients from non-osteoporotic ones was very high: a sensitivity of 90.0% and specificity of 91.8% was detected.

JOUR,abs1134?fragility score in radiographic axial spondyloarthritis assessed with radiofrequency echographic multi-spectrometry (rems),abstract,10.1016/j.ard.2025.06.1789,"['Bischoff, E.', 'Kirilov, N.', 'Baraliakos, X.']",2025,"Background: A reduction of bone mineral density (BMD) is frequent already early in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) due to systemic and local inflammatory activity. Although Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) remains the standard for diagnosing osteoporosis and assessing fracture risk, BMD measure alone is insufficient in radiographic (r)-axSpA due to the formation of syndesmophytes, while the trabecular bone score (TBS) may provide some additional information. Radiofrequency Echographic Multi-Spectrometry (REMS) is an innovative technology based on ultrasound signals performed by an echographic scan. Objectives: To prospectively evaluate REMS-based fragility scores (FS) and fracture risk in r-axSpA patients and compare them with healthy controls. Methods: An EchoStudio device (Echolight S.p.a., Lecce, Italy) with a 3.5 MHz transducer was used for a trans-abdominal scan of the L1-L4 vertebrae. The device generates a patient-specific spectrum to estimate BMD and corresponding T-score, with FS ranging from 0 to 100 to assess skeletal fragility independently of BMD. Lower FS values indicate better bone quality and lower fracture risk. The risk class (R1–R7) is determined by combining FS and REMS T-scores, with higher classes indicating higher fracture risk. FS on the lumbar spine predicts total risk for major osteoporotic fractures (MOF) per 5 years. Results: We assessed the FS of the spine using REMS in 25 established r-axSpA subjects and compared them to 50 unmatched controls. The mean age of r-axSpA subjects was 48±6 years (40–60 years). The mean age of the control group was 56±7 years (range 50-70 years). The mean body mass index (BMI) of r-axSpA subjects was 27.5±4.5 kg/m² (range 22-32 kg/m²). The mean BMI of the control group was 32.5±6 kg/m² (range 27-40 kg/m²). Overall, 60% of the axSpA and 64% of the control group subjects were female. The FS of r-axSpA subjects (45.6±16.5, R5 category, indicating an intermediate fracture risk, bordering on high fracture risk for MOF in the next 5 years) was significantly higher than that of the control group (33.2±16.3, R4 category, indicating an intermediate fracture risk range for MOF in the next 5 years but was not",Scie

The thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) plays a crucial role in biomechanical stability by transmitting and distributing forces across the spine and torso [2]. Beyond its mechanical properties, the TLF has nociceptive capabilities, contributing to pain perception through inflammatory or structural changes. Microinjuries, adhesions, or inflammation can lead to sensitization of dorsal horn neurons, exacerbating pain signals and creating a feedback loop of chronic discomfort [3, 4]. Previous studies have implicated the TLF as a significant contributor to chronic low back pain (CLBP), revealing associations with increased thickness, restricted mobility, and altered morphology [2, 3]. While the structural role of the TLF in chronic pain has been explored extensively, its relationship with inflammatory conditions like ax-SpA remains underinvestigated. Moreover, the presence of painful myofascial trigger points (MTPs), which are common in CLBP, has not been evaluated in the context of ax-SpA. Objectives: This study aims to address this gap by investigating the relationships between TLF thickness, morphology (via ultrasonography), and the presence of MTPs in ax-SpA patients compared to healthy controls. By utilizing ultrasonography, a reliable and non-invasive diagnostic tool, the study seeks to explore the potential of TLF-related changes as biomarkers for disease activity and progression in ax-SpA. Methods: 84 patients diagnosed with ax-SpA according to ASAS criteria and 58 healthy individuals were included. Demographic data for all of the participants were recorded.

FIL significantly improved multiple disease domains vs placebo (PBO) in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in the multicenter, double-blind, phase 2 EQUATOR trial (NCTNCT03101670) [1]. Objectives To evaluate the effect of FIL vs PBO on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in EQUATOR and the extent to which effects on composite disease endpoints translate to clinically relevant improvements for patients. Methods Patients were randomized 1:1 to FIL 200 mg or PBO once daily for 16 weeks [1]. Patients Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PtGADA), pain intensity (visual analog scale), Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS), and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue scale (FACIT-F) were assessed at week 16.

Proportions of patients achieving normative PRO scores or minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) were compared using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests [2, 3]. Results FIL significantly improved multiple PROs vs PBO at week 16 (Table). Proportions of patients reaching normative PRO values for FACIT-F and SF-36 PCS (=40 or 50, respectively), and achieving MCIDs in HAQ-DI and SF-36 PCS, were significantly greater for FIL vs PBO (Table).

Objectives To determine the predictive value in term of fragility fracture risk reduction of the REMS T-score compared to DXA T-score in a representative female population. Methods We enrolled 1370 women (30-90 y, BMI ? 35 kg/m2) from 2013 to 2017. We performed in all patients both DXA and REMS lumbar scans. All analyses were performed under the strictest adherence to the corresponding guidelines. All patients underwent a follow-up lasting up to 5 years to assess the incidence of fragility fractures. Patients were stratified in two groups: patients who suffered a fragility fracture during the follow-up period (Group X) and those who did not (Group Y). Through an iterative process, the two groups were then age-matched with an enrolment proportion of 1:2. The finally obtained groups were identified as Group A (with incident fractures) and Group B (without incident fractures). The performance of REMS T-score in discriminating between Group A and Group B was quantitatively assessed and compared with DXA. Results Fragility fractures incidence was 14.0% (192 out of 1370 patients, mean follow-up 3.6 ± 0.8 years). Group A included 180 patients (mean age 67.2 ± 7.2 years) and Group B included 360 patients (mean age 67.3 ± 3.5 y). Group A and Group B did not show significant differences with respect to height (p=0.41), weight (p=0.68) and BMI (p=0.32).

However, there is controversial evidence about the association between bariatric surgery and fracture risk. This may be due to the fundamental differences between patients undergoing bariatric surgery with patients who do not, raising the question: within patients who fracture, are they are at increased risk of fracture after surgery? And if so, who is at risk of fracture? Objectives 1. To investigate the association between bariatric surgery and risk of three fracture locations using a within person study design comparing a) the 5 year incidence post surgery to the 5 year pre surgery, b) splitting the 5 year post surgery risk into two windows 0-2 and 2.01 – 5 years. 2. To predict who is at risk of fracture following bariatric surgery. Methods A self-controlled case series analysis (SCCS) and Stepwise logistic regression (LR) were conducted. Patients undergoing bariatric surgery were identified in the clinical practice research datalink (CPRD) GOLD dataset and linked to hospital episode statistics (HES) data. Primary outcome was any fracture (any skeletal sites except skull and digits). Secondary outcomes were major (hip, spine, forearm and humerus) and peripheral fractures (forearm and lower leg). For the SCCS, Poisson models in those who fractured were fit to calculate Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) for the aforementioned time windows. Potential predictors were selected with an exit p-value of 0.157 and their predictive performance was reported using a C-statistic. Results Of 5,492 patients undergoing bariatric surgery, 252 patients had 272 any fractures, 75 (80) major fractures and 126 (135) peripheral fractures. Average BMI was 43.9.

REMS (Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry) is a non-ionizing instrument used to quantitatively evaluate bone mineral density at lumbar spine and femoral neck sites [1]. Objectives To assess the accuracy of REMS in osteoporosis diagnosis at axial sites (lumbar spine and hip) compared with the gold standard, Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Methods We enrolled patients aged from 50 to 75 years and perfomed a total of 1,699 and 1,794 lumbar spine and proximal femur scans with REMS and DXA. A quality checks on DXA and REMS acquired data were performed through direct examination of scans by experienced operators. We investigated the agreement between the two techniques calculating: Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), Standard Error of the Estimate (SEE) and efficiency (sensitivity and specificity) in identifying osteoporotic individuals (i.e. T-score ? -2.5). Results We found a good linear correlation between REMS and DXA BMD estimation, Pearson coefficient r=0.938 for lumbar spine and r=0.933 for proximal femur (p<0.001 for both). SEE values were 5.2% and 5.8% for lumbar spine and femoral site, respectively. In addition, REMS demonstrated a high sensitivity (92.9% and 92.3% for spine and femur) and specificity (93.5% for spine and 92.6% for femur) for the discrimination of osteoporotic patient. Moreover, considering together all the diagnostic classification categories (healthy, osteopenia and osteoporosis), the diagnostic agreement between REMS and DXA was 90.2% and 89.3% for lumbar spine and proximal femur sites, respectively. Conclusion REMS exhibited a high sensitivity and specificity in identifying osteoporotic patients at lumbar spine or proximal femur sites compared with gold-standard DXA.

Previous studies estimated that approximately one-third of the RA patients had osteoporosis (OP). However, most fragility fractures occur in patients not suffering from OP, that can be partly explained by impaired quality of bone, which is not measured with DXA. Therefore, only the measurement of bone mineral density is not sufficient to determine the indication for OP treatment. Another tool for assessing the need for anti-osteoporotic therapy is to calculate the 10-year probability of a major fracture using the fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX). Objectives: To assess the need for anti-osteoporotic therapy in women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) based on the identification of individuals with fragility fractures and high risk of fracture according to FRAX. Methods: 295 postmenopausal women with RA were included in the study. The average age was 63±7 years, the duration of RA was 11 [4;16] years, the duration of postmenopausal period was 13 [6; 20] years. 121 (41%) patients took glucocorticoids (cumulative dose 9025 [3650; 20720] mg in prednisolone equivalent). A survey was conducted to identify patients with risk factors and a history of fragility fractures. The 10-year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture was assessed using the FRAX tool. In patients treated with glucocorticoids at a dose >7.5 mg in prednisolone equivalent the estimates of probabilities of a major osteoporotic fracture were adjusted in accordance with the recommendations [1].

However, the precise effects on cortical and trabecular bone are not fully clarified. Objectives: To investigate the effect of romosozumab on three-dimensional QTC-like parameters of cortical and trabecular compartments of the proximal femur. Table 1. Methods: We conducted a 6-monhts prospective observational study on postmenopausal women treated with romosozumab. Image files of the hip DXA scans at baseline and after 6 months of romosozumab were transferred for DXA-based 3D modeling (3D-SHAPER v2.10.1, Galgo Medical, Spain). In brief, the software built a QCT-like 3D proximal femur model for each DXA image, based on a database of QCT scans from a reference population. Integral, cortical and trabecular vBMD (mg/cm3) were extracted. Other 3D-DXA measurements included: Cortical surface sBMD (mg/cm2), cortical BMC (g), cortical and trabular volume (cm3), cortical Thickness (mm), cross-sectional area (CSA, cm2) and cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI, cm4). Results: 19 post-menopausal women were included in the study. The increase in aBMD were paralleled by a significant increase in most trabecular parameters but not cortical parameters.

JOUR,pos0296?radiofrequency echographic multi-spectrometry (rems) and dxa for the evaluation of bone mineral density in axial spondyloarthritis,abstract,10.1136/annrheumdis-2024-eular.4146,"['Fassio, A.', 'Pollastri, F.', 'Benini, C.', 'Galvagni, I.', 'Dartizio, C.', 'Gatti, D.', 'Rossini, M.', 'Viapiana, O.', 'Adami, G.']",2024,"Background: Osteoporosis and bone loss represent a significant complication in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) [1]. Radiofrequency Echographic Multi-Spectrometry (REMS) is a novel technique already validated in assessing Bone Mineral Density (BMD) in post-menopausal osteoporosis [2]. It is characterized by its agile machinery and the absence of ionizing radiation. Additionally, REMS is robust against artifacts, which are known to affect Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA), especially at the lumbar spine (LS) - including aortic calcifications and osteophytes [3]. Objectives: The aim of this real-life, cross-sectional, explorative study was to compare REMS with DXA in assessing BMD in patients affected by axSpA. Methods: LS and femur scans were acquired using both techniques, including LS latero-lateral (LL) DXA scans. ANOVA for repeated measures was utilized to compare the differences in T-scores among DXA anteroposterior (AP), LL, and REMS scans at the LS, as well as between DXA and REMS T-scores at the total hip (TH) and femoral neck (FN). The correlation between the T-scores at the hip site was assessed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results: A total of 55 patients were enrolled (see Table 1). No significant differences were found between the BMD T-scores measured through DXA or REMS at the femur. At the lumbar spine, the DXA AP mean T-score was significantly higher than those obtained through LL DXA and REMS (Figure 1). A strong positive correlation was observed between the T-scores obtained with the two techniques, both at the TH (r=0.80, p <0.01) and FN (r=0.77, p <0.01). Conclusion: Our findings indicate a notable concordance between DXA and REMS in assessing T-scores at the femoral sites in SpA patients. Particularly at the LS, REMS may offer more precise BMD measurements in this distinct patient group, where DXA assessments are potentially confounded by the presence of syndesmophytes REFERENCES: [1] Yan F, Wu L, Lang J, Huang Z (2024) Bone density and fracture risk factors in ankylosing spondylitis: a meta-analysis.

However, FRAX has several limitations in assessing the risk of fracture in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In 2013 V.A. Nasonova Reasearch Institute of Rheumatology (Russia) developed a predictive mathematical model for assessing the risk of osteoporotic fractures in RA, which includes 2 main risk factors: cumulative glucocorticoid dose (GC), decrease in BMD in the femoral neck to osteoporosis, and 2 additional factors: for patients under 65 years of age - the presence of ischemic heart disease, and for people over 65 - a history of gastric ulcer or duodenal ulcer. Objectives: To compare accuracy of osteoporotic fracture risk prediction in patients with RA using the predictive model developed at V.A. Nasonova Reasearch Institute of Rheumatology (IR) and FRAX. Methods: This monocentric (single-center) prospective study included 70 patients with RA, aged 40 to 80 years. The follow-up period - 8.0 ± 1.2 years; mean age at the baseline was 55.4±7.8 years old; the mean disease duration at the baseline - 14,7±10,2 years. All patients retrospectively calculated the 10-year probability of fractures and prognostic model developed by the IR. Results: According to the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool, 32 (46%) patients had a low risk of osteoporotic fractures, 38 (54%) had a high risk. According to the predictive model of IR 33 (47%) patients had a low risk of osteoporotic fractures, 37 (53%) had a high risk. During the follow-up period, osteoporotic fractures were occurred in 18 (26%) patients: 14 (78%) of them had a high risk of fractures according to the predictive IR model, and 13 (72%) patients - according to the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool.

The principle of this technology is based on the analysis of native raw unfiltered ultrasound signals, the so called radiofrequency ultrasound signals, acquired during an echographic scan of the lumbar spine and/or femoral neck. [1]. A previous published study showed a high degree of correlation between the T-score values provided by the two techniques-REMS and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry for both lumbar spine and femoral neck [2]. REMS software outputs information about BMD (g/cm2), T-scores, Z-scores [standard deviations (SD)], percentage of body fat and basal metabolic rate [BMR (kcal/daily)] [3]. Objectives: The aim of the current study is to investigate the multivariate significant risk factors for reduced BMD through REMS technology. Methods: In this study, a total of 273 women with mean age 62 years (yrs.) ± 12 yrs. (range 25-88 yrs.) underwent REMS assessments. Subjects were divided into two groups after acquiring information about the spinal T-scores: 1st group with T-scores ?-1 SD and 2nd group with T-scores <-1 SD. Age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), basal metabolic rate (BMR), body fat and menopausal status were the risk factors included in the multivariate statistical analyses. Binary logistic regression was used to assess which are the significant risk factors for T-score <-1 SD. Youden's indices were calculated for selecting the cut-off points for each risk factor. Results: 273 women had mean weight of 70.5 kg. ± 15.7 kg. (range 39.4-127 kg.), mean height 157.1 cm. ± 8.8 cm.

Objectives: Our study aimed to evaluate the reliability of VFA as assessed by a rheumatologist and a radiology technician. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study assessing the performance of low-radiation single energy x-ray absorptiometry VFA for the detection of VF. We selected patients who were assessed for osteoporosis according to screening protocols. Bone mineral densitometry was measured using standard methods over the lumbar spine L1-L4, the total proximal femur, and results were expressed as T-scores. All VFA were independently evaluated by 2 experienced readers: a rheumatologist and a radiology technician for the identification of VF (T4-L4). VF was classified according to the Genant grading system: grade 1 for an anterior, mid or posterior reduction of 20–25% in vertebral height; grade 2 for a reduction of 25– 40% and grade 3 for a reduction of more than 40% in vertebral height. A score for the inter-rater reliability between the readers was expressed using the kappa statistic. Results: One hundred patients were included with a mean age of 66.9 ± 9.5 years [46.7-83] years. There was a female predominance (91%). Nearly half of patients had osteopenia (48.9%), 27.7% had osteoporosis and 23.4% had a normal bone mineral density. On VFA scans, the non-visible vertebra was mostly located in the upper thoracic spine (60%). The mean number of VF was 1.2 [0-3] for both readers. According to the doctor's evaluation, 25% of patients had at least one VF, of which 75.9% had a Genant grade 1, 17.2% had a Genant 2, and 6.9% had a VF grade 3. According to the technician evaluation, at least one VF was found in 36% of patients. A grade 1 was assessed in 91.7% of cases, a grade 2 in 8.3% of patients but no VF grade 3 was assessed. A kappa score for the inter-rater reliability between the readers for VFA was 0.545 (p=0.000). The overall agreement by grade between the readers was 0.785 (p=0,000).

Methods: The inclusion criteria were: Caucasian women; age between 30 and 90 years; referral by their clinician for spinal DXA assessment; absence of significant walking impairment; signed informed consent. Patients underwent DXA and REMS scans at the lumbar spine, according to the procedures described in Di Paola et al. [1], including an a-posteriori quality check of the examinations in order to guarantee the maximum reliability of the diagnostic outputs. Three groups of patients were considered according to BMI:: underweight (BMI<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (BMI?18.5 kg/m2 and <25 kg/m2), and overweight/obese (BMI?25 kg/m2). DXA and REMS BMD values were also stratified in 3 diagnostic categories: osteoporotic, osteopenic, or healthy. The degree of correlation between DXA and REMS BMD values was quantified by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). The diagnostic concordance between REMS and DXA was assessed by Cohen's K considering the 3 diagnostic categories. REMS´s sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for discriminating patients with and without osteoporosis were also calculated using DXA outcomes as reference. The same statistics were calculated accepting a 0.3 T-score tolerance on T-score values of borderline cases [1].

And although it is a novel therapeutic agent for osteoporosis, which has shown high effects of increasing bone density and inhibiting fragile fracture in overseas clinical trials. However the clinical efficacy in daily clinical practice is unknown. Objectives: To evaluate the early clinical efficacy of ROM in patients with osteoporosis between rheumatoid arthritis (RA-OP) and primary osteoporosis (P-OP) for 6 months. Methods: RA patients diagnosed according to the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria. RA-OP and P-OP patients met at least one of the following criteria were eligible; a bone mineral density T score of -2,5 or less at the lumber spine or total hip and either one or more moderate or severe vertebral fractures or two or more mild vertebral fractures. All patients were initiated ROM from between March and June, 2019. The total number of patients was 15 cases, including 8 RA-OP and 7 P-OP. All patients received continuous ROM therapy more than 6 months. The DMB dose was 210mg at once every 1 months. In all cases native or activated vitamin D has been used. We reviewed the results for 6 months about the increase and decrease of bone mineral density (BMD) of lumbar spine(LS) and total hip(TH) by DEXA and bone turnover markers, intact n-terminal propeptide type I procollagen(PINP) and tartrate-resistant acid phopshatate form 5b(TRACP-5b).

Objectives: To investigate the effectiveness of the T-score values provided by REMS scans at FN and LS in the identification of frail patients at risk for osteoporotic fractures and to compare the performance of REMS with the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) one. Methods: The patients underwent DXA and REMS scans at FN and at LS. Five clusters of fractures occurred during a median 3.5-year follow-up were identified whether involving the upper limb (forearm, elbow, humerus, wrist, hand), lower limb (tibia, ankle, metatarsus), thorax (shoulder blade, shoulder, rib), hip (femur or pelvis bones), or vertebrae. The ability of REMS and DXA T-score values to assess the incidence and site of fractures was evaluated through an analysis of covariance. Results: Seven hundred twenty-one Caucasian women were enrolled. Ninety-five fractures occurred, in particular 41 at upper limb, 16 at hip, 15 at thorax, 14 at lower limb, 9 at vertebrae. Patients characteristics are reported in table. Considering subcategories of fractured patients, there were not statistically significant differences for age, height, weight and BMI. In the analysis of covariance including age and BMI as covariates, the difference of T-score values between fractured and non-fractured patients is statistically significant for REMS and DXA at both sites. Lower FN T-score values were found for patients with fractures at hip or vertebra with respect to non-fractured patients both for REMS and DXA (p<0.001).

In the meantime, historically postfracture osteoporosis medication use rates have been poor. Objectives: The aim is to analyze the management of osteoporosis in patients hospitalized for osteoporotic fractures (OF) at Nancy University Hospital (France) in 2017. Methods: Total number of hospitalized patients and hospital stays were extracted by the Department of Medical Information (DIM) which selected departments with at least forty hospitalizations with Medical Unit Summary related to a diagnosis of fracture or osteoporosis. Hospitalizations not concerned by a recent OF were excluded. Data on fractures, patient characteristics, risk factors for OF and fall, management of osteoporosis, discharge status, stay duration, were studied from patient medical records. Prevalence of OF stays, management of osteoporosis and factors associated with duration of stay were analyzed. Results: Out of a total of 153,840 hospitalizations, 918 hospitalizations (844 patients, mean age 74.5 years ± 13.6, 74.5% women) concern an OF. The prevalence of hospitalizations for OF was 0.6% of total hospitalizations and 17.9% of total hospitalizations for fractures. Among the 844 patients, 85.7% had a severe fracture (vertebral fracture: 56.2%, hip fracture: 24.1%), 16.5% had a non-severe fracture, and 8.5% had a fracture cascade in the year. At discharge from hospital, 11.7% of patients received a specific treatment for osteoporosis. Longer stay duration was associated with age, severe fractures, Groll index and discharge status. Conclusion: Nearly one hospitalized fracture in five is osteoporotic, while only one in ten patients is treated for osteoporosis. Stay duration increased with age and comorbidities. This encourages the development of early prevention, screening and treatment strategies for osteoporosis. References: [1]Hernlund E, Svedbom A, Ivergård M, Compston J, Cooper C, Stenmark J, et al.

Objectives: To investigate bone metabolic changes in postmenopausal women assuming lemon juice. Methods: Participants were postmenopausal osteoporotic women without history of clinical fractures who agreed to enrich their diet with lemon juice (Acti Lemon, Polenghi) over a 2-month period. The daily juice dose of 30 ml we suggested was equivalent to one Sicilian organic lemon. Surrogate markers of bone formation as procollagen type 1 N-propeptide (P1NP) and of bone resorption as C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), but also some regulators of bone metabolism as RANK-L, OPG, RANK-L/OPG ratio and sclerostin were assessed at baseline and then at 1 and 2 months after lemon juice administration. Controls were represented by a placebo group of age-matched osteoporotic postmenopausal women. Results: 47 participants [mean age 60.2 ± 4.1 yr.] completed the study, without reporting any adverse events. Lemon juice was well tolerated. Over the observation period modifications of bone metabolism occurred: we detected a decreased RANK-L/OPG ratio and increased CTX levels at all time points vs. baseline. Particularly, change at month-1 of sclerostin (versus baseline) has been positively associated with change at month-1 and month-2 of CTX (r=0.46, p=0.01 and r=0.43, p=0.01, respectively). Change at month-1 of OPG was positively associated with change at month-1 of P1NP (r=0.49, p=0.006). Change at month-1 of RANKL/OPG has been related with variation at day 30 of P1NP (r=-0.44, p=0.013). Variation of P1NP at month-1 was related with sclerostin variation at day 30 (r=-0.56, p=0.02) and month-2 vs. baseline value (r=0.44, p=0.017) and with sclerostin variation between month-1 and month-2 (r=0.69, p<0.001). Variation of P1NP between month-1 and month-2 was associated with RANKL change at month-1 (r=-0.35, p=0.05), with sclerostin change at month-1 (r=-0.49, p=0.008) and with sclerostin change between month-1 and month-2 (r=0.41, p=0.028).

Denosumab (i.e. 60 mg twice a year) is a viable therapy against bone resorption, but the short-term monitoring of bone mineral density (BMD) change with time is still an unmet clinical need, since the current techniques (including dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, DXA) require 1-2 years between two consecutive measurements [1]. Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS), with high performance in terms of precision and repeatability [2], might be used in this setting of patients for short-term monitoring of bone health-related parameters. Objectives: The objective is the short-term monitoring of the effect of AIs with/without denosumab on bone health in BC patients using REMS and DXA scans at lumbar spine. Methods: Post-menopausal ER+ BC patients treated with adjuvant AIs were recruited. Two subgroups were identified, whether receiving also 60 mg of denosumab therapy every 6 months or not (named Group A and Group B, respectively). All patients underwent baseline DXA and REMS lumbar spine scans at time T0, previous to the first AI therapy, and after 12 months (time T1). REMS scan only was repeated also at 18 months (T2), since a 6-month interval between two consecutive scans is not recommended for DXA. The bone mineral density (BMD) was measured with both techniques. Results: Overall, 254 ER+ BC patients were enrolled (127 per group). The effect of denosumab on BMD is reported in Table. The BMD values obtained by DXA and REMS were not significantly different at T0 and T1, whereas the difference between Group A and B at T1 was statistically significant (p<0.001) both for REMS and DXA. At T2, REMS confirmed the increasing trend of BMD for Group A and the decreasing one for Group B, and the difference between groups was statistically significant (p<0.001). For each time point and each group, there were not statistically significant differences between DXA and REMS.

However, few long-term studies describe the independent association of these structural factors and total knee replacement (TKR) in older adults. Objectives: To describe whether cartilage defects, bone marrow lesions (BMLs), effusion-synovitis, and meniscal pathologies at baseline are associated with TKR over 13 years and to estimate the additive effect of these measures for risk prediction of TKR. Methods: 1082 participants (mean age 62.8 years, 50% female) were randomly recruited from Tasmania and followed over 13.3 years. A 1.5T MRI scan of the right knee was acquired at baseline (n=930). Cartilage defects (grade 0-4), BMLs (grade 0-3), effusion-synovitis (grade 0-3), meniscal tears (grade 0-3) and meniscal extrusion (grade 0-2) was scored at baseline using T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI. WOMAC knee pain was recorded from questionnaires and radiographic OA (ROA) was assessed by OARSI scale. The incidence of primary (first-time) TKR was determined by data linkage to the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR). Log binomial regression were used to estimate the risk of TKR associated with baseline MRI measures, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, ROA, and pain. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were used and area under the curves (AUCs) were compared. Results: After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and ROA status, baseline cartilage defects (grade 2, RR=6.71; grade 3, RR=11.17; grade 4, RR=13.2; all p<0.01) were consistently and significantly associated with TKR over 13 years. These associations remained significant after further adjustment for other MRI pathologies. BMLs (grade 1, RR=2.74; grade 2, RR=2.64; grade 3 RR=4.01, all p<0.05 except grade 2), grade 3 effusion-synovitis (RR=2.74, p<0.05) and suprapatellar effusion-synovitis area were associated with TKR over 13 years. However, these associations of BMLs and effusion-synovitis with TKR were largely dependent on cartilage defects.

Rheumatologists quite oftenly face with these patients which is termed as inflammation of unknown origin (UIO). Differential diagnosis of UIO is diverse and investigation of such cases are challenging and time consuming. Objectives: to assess diagnostic utility of PET CT in the diagnosis of patients with UIO Methods Study comprised 68 (36 male, mean age 58.7±14.8, range 19-87 years) adult IUO subjects without a previous diagnosis of an inflammatory or malignant disease. Patients were screened with PET CT after 8 hours fasting, if a specific diagnosis could not be established with comprehensive evaluation including; meticulous history and physical examination, pertinent microbiologic cultures, brucella agglutination, Mantoux test, serum protein electrophoresis, echocardiography, plain x-rays, computed tomography of thorax and abdomen/pelvis. Results Final diagnosis were established in follow up were inflammatory diseases in 37 (54.4%), malignant disorders in 16 (23.5%) and infections in 5 (7.4%), whereas a final diagnosis cannot be made in 10 (14.7%). PET CT aided diagnosis in 40 (58.8%) patients but was ineffective in 28 (41.2%). All three PET CT positive subjects with a final diagnosis of infection had tuberculosis (tb).

Moreover, a common condition represented by osteoarthritis, by modifying the joint soft tissues composition, can alter the values of BMD [2]. In patients affected by discarthrosis, in fact, osteoporotic T-score values at femoral neck (FN) can be associated with normal or osteopenic T-score values of the lumbar spine (LS), the latter influenced by the presence of osteophytes and/or subchondral bone sclerosis. Objectives: To evaluate the predictive value of an innoative densitometric technique, the Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS) [3], in detecting bone fragility in patients affected by osteoarthitis. Methods: The T-score values of 35 postmenopausal women with clinical and/or radiological signs of osteoarthritis (mean age 71 years, average BMI 24,2) obtained by DXA at lumbar spine and femoral neck were compared with those obtained by REMS technique performed in the same anatomical sites. Results: In all the subjects, LS T-score resulted significantly higher than the FN one according to DXA measurement. However, REMS outcomes in both the sites were significantly lower than the corresponding DXA measurement (significant difference between DXA and REMS T-score for both LS (p = 0.006) and FN (p = 0.010), and spinal REMS T-scores resulted more similar to femural REMS (average REMS T-score LS: -2.6 ± 1,6 vs T-score FN: -2.4 ± 0, 6) and to femural DXA values. Conclusion: These preliminary data suggest that REMS technique, which has been shown to have high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy when compared with DXA in diagnosing and monitoring osteoporosis [3], is not affected by the presence of alterated soft tissues composition. it would therefore be particularly useful for the evaluation of bone fragility in subjects at risk of osteoarthritis.

In Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) many studies show that ultrasonography (US) is superior to clinical exam for the detection of synovitis and has good correlation with clinical findings and markers of inflammation and can be used to improve the certainty of a diagnosis of RA.1. However, few studies address the agreement between the US with the clinical examination in patients with early arthritis. Objectives: To evaluate the agreement between clinical examination and US findings of metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of patients with early arthritis Methods: Patients from the EAC of our department with suspect arthralgia were included. Patients were submitted to clinical evaluation by a rheumatologist to identify tender and swollen joints. They were then submitted to an US examination of metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, by an experienced sonographer oblivious of the previous examination. Each joint was scored for the presence of synovial hypertrophy (SH) and Power Doppler (PD) signal. Based on OMERACT guidance, we defined synovitis as: ? grade 1 grey scale synovitis (hypoechoic SH regardless of the presence of effusion) and ? grade 1 power-Doppler. The diagnostic value of clinical evaluation was assessed through sensitivity, specificity, Negative predictive value (NPV) and Positive predictive value (PPV), assuming the US synovitis as gold standard. Clinical arthritis was defined by joint swelling. Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to analyse concordance between joint swelling appreciated by clinical exam and HS, PD and the presence of US synovitis. Kappa values < 0 were considered poor, 0-0.20 slight, 0.21-0.40 fair, 0.41-0.60 moderate, 0.61-0.80 good and 0.81-1.00 excellent.2 Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05.

The comparison of BIS with bromide dilution and DXA was analyzed using linear regression and the Bland-Altman method., RESULTS: At baseline, there was a significant correlation between BIS and bromide dilution-derived estimates for ECW, and DXA for FM and FFM (P<0.001). ECW by BIS was 3.5 +/- 8.1% lower compared with bromide dilution, while FM was 22.4 +/- 26.8% lower and FFM 13.7 +/- 7.5% higher compared with DXA (P<0.01). During treatment, the change in ECW was similar between BIS and bromide dilution, whereas BIS gave a significantly greater reduction in FM (19.4 +/- 44.8%) and a greater increase in FFM (5.6 +/- 3.0%) compared with DXA (P<0.01). Significant differences in body composition estimates between the BIS and DXA were observed only in men, particularly during the treatment that caused greatest change in water compartments and body composition., CONCLUSION: In healthy adults, bioimpedance spectroscopy is an acceptable tool for measuring ECW; however, BIS overestimates FFM and substantially underestimates FM compared with DXA.

This study focused on the association of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) and cardiovascular events assessed using a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scoring methodology for AAC., Methods: From 2008 to 2014, renal transplant recipients referred for a DXA procedure within 6 months after transplantation were included in a retrospective, single-centre study. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of cardiovascular events, defined as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischaemic attack, after transplantation. AAC was quantified using an 8-point scoring system and patients were divided into three groups; a control group (AAC = 0), a low AAC group (AAC = 1-3) and a high AAC group (AAC = 4-8)., Results: We evaluated 701 patients, 267 (38.1%) had detectable calcifications (low AAC 190 patients, high AAC 77 patients) and 434 (61.9%) had no calcifications. Cardiovascular events were seen in 37 (8.5%) patients in the control group, in 18 (9.5%) in the low AAC group and in 20 (26.0%) in the high AAC group. Univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis of the high AAC score showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 4.23 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.44-7.33; P < 0.01] for cardiovascular events, while results were not significant for the low AAC score. Multivariate analysis showed an independent significant association between a high AAC score and cardiovascular events [HR 2.78 (95% CI 1.05-7.64); P = 0.04]. Assessment of the continuous net reclassification index (NRI), comparing the combined clinical variables with a model of both AAC scoring and clinical variables, showed an NRI of 0.76 (95% CI 0.65-0.86; P < 0.01)., Conclusions: An independent association between a high AAC score, assessed by DXA, and cardiovascular events was identified and provides an opportunity for early cardiovascular risk stratification in renal transplant recipients.",ovid

The aim of this study was to show that skeletal ratios, such as length of femur to height, could be accurately measured from a DXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) image., METHODS: 90 normal Caucasian females, 18-80 years old, with whole body DXA data were used as subjects. Two methods, linear pixel count (LPC) and reticule and ruler (RET) were used to measure skeletal sizes on DXA images and compared with real clinical measures from 20 subjects and 20 x-rays of the femur and tibia taken in 2003., RESULTS: Although both methods were highly correlated, the LPC inter- and intra-observer error was lower at 1.6% compared to that of RET at 2.3%. Both methods correlated positively with real clinical measures, with LPC having a marginally stronger correlation coefficient (r2 = 0.94; r2 = 0.84; average r2 = 0.89) than RET (r2 = 0.86; r2 = 0.84; average r2 = 0.85) with X-rays and real measures respectively. Also, the time taken to use LPC was half that of RET at 5 minutes per scan., CONCLUSION: Skeletal ratios can be accurately and precisely measured from DXA total body scan images. The LPC method is easy to use and relatively rapid. This new phenotype will be useful for osteoporosis research for individuals or large-scale epidemiological or genetic studies.",ovid

Body composition was evaluated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)., RESULTS: Sixty percent (25/40) of the participants met standard criteria for physical frailty. Frail (FR) and nonfrail (NF) participants were comparable in age, sex, CD4 count, and viral load. FR HOA had greater impairments in PPT, peak oxygen uptake, FSQ, walking speed, balance, and muscle quality than NF HOA. FR HOA had a greater body mass index (BMI), fat mass, and truncal fat with lipodystrophy. Moreover, PPT score was inversely related to trunk fat (correlation coefficient (r) = -0.34; P = .04) and ratio of intermuscular fat to total fat (r = -0.60; P = .02) after adjusting for covariates., CONCLUSION: HOA represent an emerging cohort of older adults who frequently experience frailty at a much younger age than the general older population.

There have been previous reports of normative BMD data for Caucasian and Asian children including Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Indian. However, the normative BMD data for Southeast Asian including Thai children and adolescents are not currently available. The goals of our study were 1) to establish normative data of BMD, bone mineral content (BMC), bone area (BA) and lean body mass (LBM) for healthy Thai children and adolescents; aged 5-18 years measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Lunar Prodigy) and 2) to evaluate the relationships between BMD vs. age, sex, puberty, weight, height, calcium intake and the age of menarche in our population. Gender and age-specific BMD (L2-4; LS and total body; TB), BMADLS (apparent BMD of the lumbar spine), BMC (L2-4 and total body), BA (L2-4 and total body) and LBM were evaluated in 367 children (174 boys and 193 girls). All parameters increased progressively with age. A rapid increase in BMD, BMC and BMADLS was observed at earlier ages in girls. Gender and Tanner stage-specific BMD normative data were also generated. The dynamic changes of BMD values from childhood to early and late puberty of Thai children appeared to be consistent with those of Caucasian and Asian populations. Using a multiple-regression, weight and Tanner stage significantly affected BMDLS, BMDTB and BMADLS in both genders. Only in girls, height was found to have significant influence on BMDTB and BMADLS. The positive correlation between BMD and several demographic parameters, except the calcium intake, was observed. In summary, we established a normal BMD reference for Thai children and adolescents and this will be of useful for clinicians and researchers to appropriately assess BMD in Thais and other Southeast Asian children.",ovid
JOUR,a physical model for dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry--derived bone mineral density,DXA only,10.1097/00004424-200005000-0,"['Sievanen, H']",2000,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived areal bone mineral density (BMD) is an established predictor of osteoporotic fractures and reflects bone strength as well. The goal of this study was to develop and validate a physical model for appropriate interpretation of BMD., METHODS: DXA and peripheral quantitative computed tomography investigations of the distal tibia (n = 45), proximal tibia (n = 12), distal femur (n = 26), and distal radius (n = 34) were carried out. The DXA-derived BMD was analytically modeled as a nonlinear function of volumetric bone mineral apparent density and the cross-sectional area (eCSA) of given bone; ie, BMD(mod) = apparent BMD x square root of eCSA., RESULTS: At every measured skeletal site, the relationship between BMD and BMD(mod) was systematically stronger than that observed separately between BMD and apparent BMD or cross-sectional area. The models (r2) explained 85%, 94%, 87%, and 74% of the variability in BMD at the distal tibia, proximal tibia, distal femur, and distal radius, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The mutual contributions of bone density and size to BMD can vary to some extent in a site-dependent fashion. This dual nature of BMD on one hand provides a reasonable mechanical explanation for why BMD is a good surrogate of bone strength and a predictor of osteoporotic fractures but on the other hand, complicates its detailed interpretation.",ovid

Two films are taken of the infant's forearm using a standard mobile x-ray set on the ward at two x-ray energies. Included in the field of view is a double step wedge made of aluminum and Perspex. The images are digitized by viewing them on a light box with a TV camera. The bone mineral content in the forearm can then be mapped by the measurement of light intensity in matching pixels of the two films and comparison with the intensities in the step wedge. The bone mineral concentration in the radius, expressed as bone mineral per unit length (mg/mm), is calculated. The technique has been tested using phantoms of calcium hydroxylapatite set in a tissue equivalent material and in Perspex. It has been shown that the reproducibility of the technique is approximately 7% and that there is a systematic underestimate of bone mineral of about 17%. The technique has been shown to be linear up to a bone mineral concentration of 8 mg.mm-1. Longitudinal studies for 14 infants that show an initial 6-wk period of demineralization after birth with a subsequent mineralization phase are reported.",ovid
JOUR,a preliminary dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry-based finite element model for assessing osteoporotic hip fracture risk,DXA only,10.1177/0954411911424975,"['Luo, Y', 'Ferdous, Z', 'Leslie, W D']",2011,"To more accurately assess osteoporotic hip fracture risk in a specific patient, a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-based finite element model was constructed from the patient's femur DXA image. The outermost contour of the femur bone segmented from the DXA image was used to generate a finite element mesh. Bone mechanical properties, such as Young's modulus, are correlated with areal bone mineral density (BMD) captured in the DXA image. A quasi-static loading condition representing a sideway fall was applied to the finite element model. Three fracture risk indices were introduced and expressed as ratios of internal forces caused by impact forces occurring in sideway fall to bone ultimate cross-section strength at the three critical locations, i.e. the femoral neck, the intertrochanteric region, and the subtrochanteric region. The proposed finite element modelling procedure was validated against six representative clinical cases extracted from the Manitoba BMD database, where initial and follow-up DXA images have been taken to monitor longitudinal variation of areal BMD in individual patients. It was found from the clinical validation that variations in the proposed fracture risk indices have the same trends as those indicated by the conventional areal BMD and T-score. In addition, by the three proposed fracture risk indices it is possible to further identify the specific fracture location. It was also found that for the same subject, the variations in the three fracture risk indices have quite different magnitudes, with intertrochanteric region the largest and subtrochanteric region the smallest, which is probably owing to the different content of trabecular and cortical bones in the three regions. With further development, it is promising that the proposed DXA-based finite element model will be a useful tool for accurate assessment of osteoporosis development and for treatment monitoring.",ovid

To investigate the diversity of normal ranges used within the UK, a survey of all DEXA sites was carried out with a 60.6% response rate. The effect of the different ranges was evaluated by translating each range to an equivalent range for a Norland XR-26 system and applying the ranges to stratify a representative sample of over 1000 patients into grades of bone density based on percentages of age-matched mean BMD, Z-scores and T-scores. The effect of femoral neck and P/A spine L2-L4 regions was considered both separately and jointly. Large differences between the normal ranges were apparent, which resulted in the classification of the number of patients with a Z-score of less than -2.0 varying by a factor of more than 20 for the femoral neck and more than 3 for the spine. The number of patients defined as osteoporotic by a T-score less than -2.5 varied from none to over one-third of patients for the hip and by a factor of almost 3 for the spine. The exclusion criteria used for construction of the normal ranges varied markedly with none constructed using population-based sampling. Smoothing of normal ranges was carried out by DEXA manufacturers, while local normal ranges made use of raw unprocessed data. There is reason to question the validity of such processing. We recommend the construction of a unified UK normal range applicable to all UK DEXA systems in order to harmonize patient management and care.",ovid

Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the lumbar spine provides an index of abdominal fat., OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine the hypothesis that DXA-derived abdominal fat measurement in women undergoing osteoporosis investigation predicts risk for subsequent diagnosis of diabetes., DESIGN: This historical cohort study was derived from the Manitoba Bone Density Program Database for the Province of Manitoba, Canada., SETTING AND PATIENTS: 30,252 nondiabetic women aged 40 yr and older were referred for baseline osteoporosis assessment with DXA between January 1990 and March 2007., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Each woman's longitudinal provincial health service record was assessed for the presence of diabetes diagnosis codes after DXA testing., RESULTS: During 5.2 + or - 2.6 yr of observation, 1252 (4.1%) women met the case definition for diabetes. A greater proportion of abdominal fat from spine DXA was strongly related to subsequent diabetes diagnosis in models adjusted for age, body mass index, and other comorbidities. Those in the highest quintile had 3.56 (95% confidence interval = 2.67-4.75) times the risk for subsequent diabetes diagnosis compared with those in the lowest (reference) quintile. Fat from hip DXA was not predictive of subsequent diabetes after adjustment for the same variables (1.00, 95% confidence interval = 0.79-1.26)., CONCLUSIONS: Predictive information about diabetes risk can be obtained from spine DXA scans performed for osteoporosis risk assessment. This is consistent with evidence linking abdominal fat with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome.",ovid

Data were collected by standardized telephone interview. Potential correlates of DXA testing (verified by physician records), and current treatment were grouped by type as: ""predisposing characteristics,"" ""enabling resources,"" or ""need factors"" based on hypothesized relationships formulated before data collection. Variables associated with each outcome independent of ""need factors"" identified inequities in the system., RESULTS: Of the 871 participants (72% response rate), 55% had been tested by DXA and 20% were receiving treatment. Using multiple variable logistic regression to adjust for need factors, significant inequities in access to DXA testing existed by age, health beliefs, education, income, use of preventive health services, region, and provider sex. DXA testing mediated access to treatment; 34% of those having had a DXA were treated compared with 2% of those who did not. Among women with osteoporosis, correctly reporting that their DXA test indicated osteoporosis and higher perceived benefits of taking pharmacological agents for osteoporosis were associated with treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Significant inequities in access to fracture prevention exist in a region with universal health care coverage. Improved access to DXA and better communication to patients of both their DXA results and the benefits of treatment has the potential to reduce the burden of osteoporosis.",ovid

The segmentation of anterior/posterior thigh compartments was measured with participants lying on their right and left sides and the scanned leg elevated with two foam pads. Custom regions of interest (ROIs) were created manually with enCore software for each scan using bony landmarks to quantify lean, fat, and total masses. Paired t-tests assessed this novel positioning method's accuracy against standard positioning. Intraclass correlation coefficients and coefficients of variation examined inter- and intrarater reliability for lateral scan measures of total, fat, and lean masses from manually created ROIs., RESULTS: All mean +/- SD differences between frontal and lateral DXA scans of right (R) and left (L) leg total mass (R: 8.42 +/- 195.57 g; L: 19.47 +/- 131.80 g), fat mass (R: 61.26 +/- 215.66 g; L: -5.89 +/- 239.97 g), and lean mass (R: -103.00 +/- 302.54 g; L: -27.58 +/- 288.14 g) were nonsignificant (P value range = 0.15-0.91).

Only one study has reported the accuracy of lateral scans of thoracic vertebral bodies. The accuracy of DXA scans of thoracic spine segments and of anterior-posterior (AP) thoracic scans has not been investigated. We have examined the accuracy of AP and lateral thoracic DXA scans by comparison with ash weight, the gold-standard for measuring bone mineral content (BMC). We have also compared three methods of estimating volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) with a novel standard-ash weight (g)/bone volume (cm3) as measured by computed tomography (CT). Twelve T5-T8 spine segments were scanned with DXA (AP and lateral) and CT. The T6 vertebrae were excised, the posterior elements removed and then the vertebral bodies were ashed in a muffle furnace. We proposed a new method of estimating vBMD and compared it with two previously published methods. BMC values from lateral DXA scans displayed the strongest correlation with ash weight (r=0.99) and were on average 12.8% higher (p<0.001). As expected, BMC (AP or lateral) was more strongly correlated with ash weight than areal bone mineral density (aBMD; AP: r=0.54, or lateral: r=0.71) or estimated vBMD. Estimates of vBMD with either of the three methods were strongly and similarly correlated with volumetric BMD calculated by dividing ash weight by CT-derived volume. These data suggest that readily available DXA scanning is an appropriate surrogate measure for thoracic spine bone mineral and that the lateral scan might be the scan method of choice.",ovid

Forty-three older women (65.2 +/- 4.6 years, 59.5 +/- 9.2 kg, 156.4 +/- 6.0 cm, 24.3 +/- 3.3 kg.m) participated in a RT intervention (12 weeks, 8 exercises, 2 sets, 10-15 repetitions, 3 nonconsecutive days per week). Fat-free mass changes were determined by a single-frequency BIA device (EQ1), 6 BIA prediction equations for older women (EQ2, EQ3, EQ4, EQ5, EQ6, and EQ7), and DXA. At pretraining, 3 equations overpredicted, and 3 underpredicted DXA FFM (F = 244.63, p < 0.001), although all equations had high correlations with DXA (r = 0.78-0.83). After training, 4 equations overpredicted and one underpredicted DXA FFM (F = 176.25, p < 0.001).

Sixty-three studies remained for the final inclusion, with 8 focused on athletes (n = 461). Five studies were included in the meta-analysis and were rated as positive after risk of bias assessment, whereas the remaining were neutral.

Correlations are high between BIA and DXA; however, the limits of agreement are wide. Hence, BIA may not be a suitable substitute for DXA body composition scanning of athletes. Because of the low level of ionizing radiation exposure, the use of DXA should always be medically justified, and therefore, it is not recommended for repeat, longitudinal measurements in healthy subjects. We recommend that clinicians do not use BIA interchangeably with DXA in the assessment of body composition in athletes. Considerations should be made over the safety and appropriateness of DXA in young healthy adults. For long-term use, BIA can be warranted for athletes.PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42020183777.

Methods of estimating body composition such as hydrostatic weighing or dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), however, can be expensive, require extensive operator training, and, in the case of hydrostatic weighing, be highly burdensome for patients. Our objective was to evaluate air displacement plethysmography via the Bod Pod, a less burdensome method of estimating body fat percentage. In particular, we filled a gap in the literature by testing the Bod Pod at the lower extreme of the Body Mass Index (BMI) distribution., FINDINGS: Three BMI groups were recruited and underwent both air displacement plethysmography and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. We recruited 30 healthy adults at the lower BMI distribution from the Calorie Restriction (CR) Society and followers of the CR Way. We also recruited 15 normal weight and 19 overweight/obese healthy adults from the general population. Both Siri and Brozek equations derived body fat percentage from the Bod Pod, and Bland-Altman analyses assessed agreement between the Bod Pod and DXA. Compared to DXA, the Bod Pod overestimated body fat percentage in thinner participants and underestimated body fat percentage in heavier participants, and the magnitude of difference was larger for underweight BMI participants, reaching 13% in some.

In order to determine whether DEXA could be as useful for bone mineral analysis of the forearm, we compared its accuracy, precision and measurement performance to single-photon absorptiometry (SPA). There was high correlation between these techniques for integral bone mineral density in standard aluminum tubes (r = 0.99) and 30 adult volunteers or patients with osteoporosis (r = 0.95). The mean short-term precision of DEXA was 0.9% in vitro and about 1.5% in vivo. DEXA produced excellent bone images which enhance long-term in vivo precision. The measurement performance of both instruments was largely unaffected by localized fat deposits or increases in forearm thickness or proportion of fat subcutaneously. We conclude that DEXA is a clinically useful alternative to SPA for forearm bone mineral assessment.",ovid

JOUR,anthropometric variables accurately predict dual energy x-ray absorptiometric-derived body composition and can be used to screen for diabetes,DXA only,10.1371/journal.pone.0024017,"['Yavari, Reza', 'McEntee, Erin', 'McEntee, Michael', 'Brines, Michael']",2011,"The current world-wide epidemic of obesity has stimulated interest in developing simple screening methods to identify individuals with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) or metabolic syndrome (MS). Prior work utilizing body composition obtained by sophisticated technology has shown that the ratio of abdominal fat to total fat is a good predictor for DM2 or MS. The goals of this study were to determine how well simple anthropometric variables predict the fat mass distribution as determined by dual energy x-ray absorptometry (DXA), and whether these are useful to screen for DM2 or MS within a population. To accomplish this, the body composition of 341 females spanning a wide range of body mass indices and with a 23% prevalence of DM2 and MS was determined using DXA. Stepwise linear regression models incorporating age, weight, height, waistline, and hipline predicted DXA body composition (i.e., fat mass, trunk fat, fat free mass, and total mass) with good accuracy. Using body composition as independent variables, nominal logistic regression was then performed to estimate the probability of DM2. The results show good discrimination with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) having an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78. The anthropometrically-derived body composition equations derived from the full DXA study group were then applied to a group of 1153 female patients selected from a general endocrinology practice. Similar to the smaller study group, the ROC from logistical regression using body composition had an AUC of 0.81 for the detection of DM2. These results are superior to screening based on questionnaires and compare favorably with published data derived from invasive testing, e.g., hemoglobin A1c. This anthropometric approach offers promise for the development of simple, inexpensive, non-invasive screening to identify individuals with metabolic dysfunction within large populations.",ovid

BIA had better agreement with DXA in the assessment of fat free mass (FFM, R2=0.70, Sres=2.1) and fat mass (FM, R2=0.93, Sres=2.3) than the STM (FFM, R2=0.62, Sres=2.4; FM, R2=0.89,Sres=2.8). There was quite a large variation in the estimates when different BIA prediction equations were used. The equation developed in this study, FFM (kg)=-128.06 + 1.85 x BMI-0.63 x weight + 1.07 x height - 0.03 x resistance +10.0 x waist-hip ratio, yielded a small and unbiased error (0.5 +/- 1.6 kg), with a small residual standard deviation (R2=0.83, Sres=1.6). However, error associated with the estimate of FM was positively related to the degree of FM. BIA(Heitmann) equation yielded unbiased estimates of both FFM and FM (FFM, R2=0.77, Sres=1.8; FM, R2=0.95, Sres=1.9). Both the STM and BIA (manufacturer's equation) resulted in error which was statistically significant and positively correlated with FFM and FM. These results indicate that BIA prediction equations, chosen with care, can improve the performance of equations based upon anthropometric measurements alone in the assessment of body composition in elderly women.",ovid

One hundred sixty male (n = 44) and female (n = 116) collegiate athletes were enrolled: Men's Cross Country (n = 15), football linemen (n = 29), Women's Soccer (n = 27), Women's Field Hockey (n = 27), Women's Cross Country (n = 13), Women's Gymnastics (n = 16), and Women's Lacrosse (n = 33). Appendicular fat mass (FM) of the arms (AFM, right AFM, left AFM) and legs (LFM, right LFM, left LFM), appendicular fat-free mass (FFM) of the arms (AFFM, RAFFM, LAFFM) and legs (LFFM, RLFFM, LLFFM), total body FM and FFM, and total body %fat were collected from both devices. MF-BIA significantly underestimated appendicular FFM of the arms (AFFM mean difference [MD]: -0.7 kg; RAFFM: -0.4 kg; LAFFM: -0.4 kg, p < 0.001) and legs (LFFM MD: -3.8 kg; RLFFM: -1.9 kg; LLFFM: -1.9 kg, p < 0.001), and FM of the legs (LFM MD: -2.5 kg; RLFM: -1.3 kg; LLFM: -1.3 kg, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in appendicular FM measures of the arms (p = 0.174). All measures held true for male subjects and female subjects. Female subjects produced smaller differences compared with male subjects. The lack of validity, from raw and relative error, between the devices for most appendicular measures (FFM of arms and FFM and FM legs) and all total body measures (FM, FFM, and %fat) suggest that this MF-BIA may not be accurate in measuring a lean, athletic, population compared with DXA.",ovid

A total of 223 elderly people (63 men, aged 63-88, 72.32+/-6.10; 157 women, aged 61-89, 73.28+/-5.73) participated in the study. A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner was used to measure the bone mineral content and bone mineral density at total hip and femoral neck. The application of the predictive model also required a finite element simulation of the proximal femur, obtaining the mechanical damage and fracture probability maps corresponding to each sex and age groups analyzed. Statistical analysis shows higher values of bone mineral density, and consequently of Young's modulus, for men than for women. In general, a decrease of BMD is observed since 65 years old. The maximum mechanical damage value is always located at the femoral neck. The results indicate that mechanical damage tends to increase with age. Coherently with mechanical damage, the maximum fracture probability value is always located at the femoral neck and tends to increase with age. The simulation model to determine the probability of fracture is more complete than the simple measurement of bone mineral density, because provides additional information about mechanical properties of bone, and allows for a prospective detection of fracture risk. The model may be used for risk evaluation in specific patients, if anatomical and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measurements are available, helping us to decide about preventive pharmacological treatment for hip fracture.

Although low bone mineral density (BMD) has been noted in LS patients examined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), this technique does not take volume into account and may therefore underestimate the true bone density in patients with small bones. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the BMD yielded by DEXA in our LS patients using estimated volumetric values. Volumetric density was calculated with the following formulas: bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) = bone mineral content (BMC)/(area)(3/2) for the lumbar spine and BMAD = BMC/area(2) for the femoral neck. The study sample included 12 patients (mean age, 43.9 yr; mean height, 123.7 cm). Findings were compared with 10 osteopenic subjects without developmental abnormalities (mean age, 56 yr; mean height, 164.8 cm) and 10 healthy control subjects matched for sex and age to the LS patients (mean height, 165.5 cm). BMAD in the LS group was 0.201 +/- 0.02 g/cm(3) at the lumbar spine and 0.201 +/- 0.04 g/cm(3) at the femoral neck; corresponding values for the osteopenic group were 0.130 +/- 0.01 and 0.140 +/- 0.01 g/cm(3), and for the controls, 0.178 +/- 0.03 and 0.192 +/- 0.02 g/cm(3). Although areal BMD was significantly lower in the LS and osteopenic subjects compared with controls (P < 0.02) at both the lumbar spine and femoral neck, BMAD was low (P < 0.01) in the osteopenic group only.

Twenty-four women with CHD diagnosed by MPI were considered as cases, whereas the remaining 47 women with normal MPI results were considered as controls. Biochemical markers, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) were also recorded for all women and correlated to DXA adiposity indices. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the ability of DXA and anthropometrically obtained obesity indices on predicting CHD., RESULTS: Participants with CHD were found to have increased fat mass in the trunk (P < 0.01), in the android area (P < 0.01), and in the total body (P < 0.05) in agreement with the anthropometric indices WC (P < 0.01) and BMI (P < 0.05).

Beyond its direct impact, diabetes substantially increases the risk of developing severe complications such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and musculoskeletal disorders like arthritis and osteoporosis. The field of diabetes classification has advanced significantly with the use of diverse data modalities and sophisticated tools to identify individuals or groups as diabetic. But the task of predicting diabetes prior to its onset, particularly through the use of longitudinal multi-modal data, remains relatively underexplored. To better understand the risk factors associated with diabetes development among Qatari adults, this longitudinal research aims to investigate dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived whole-body and regional bone composition measures as potential predictors of diabetes onset. We proposed a case-control retrospective study, with a total of 1,382 participants contains 725 male participants (cases: 146, control: 579) and 657 female participants (case: 133, control: 524). We excluded participants with incomplete data points. To handle class imbalance, we augmented our data using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and SMOTEENN (SMOTE with Edited Nearest Neighbors), and to further investigated the association between bones data features and diabetes status, we employed ANOVA analytical method. For diabetes onset prediction, we employed both conventional and deep learning (DL) models to predict risk factors associated with diabetes in Qatari adults. We used SHAP and probabilistic methods to investigate the association of identified risk factors with diabetes. During experimental analysis, we found that bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral contents (BMC) in the hip, femoral neck, troch area, and lumbar spine showed an upward trend in diabetic patients with [Formula: see text]. Meanwhile, we found that patients with abnormal glucose metabolism had increased wards BMD and BMC with low Z-score compared to healthy participants.

Issues have been raised about hydration, software version, hardware (fan beam vs. pencil beam), and the subject population in relation to the validity of DXA-derived estimates of body composition. This paper reviews validation studies of DXA to assess the impact of recent developments in its technology. Studies by Prior et al., Kohrt et al., Salamone et al., Going et al., and Pietrobelli et al. demonstrate the effectiveness of DXA estimates of changes in body composition. By contrast, Clasey et al., Nelson et al., and Friedl et al. found limitations in DXA estimates of body composition and its changes. These contradictory conclusions were explored for threats to internal validity in each research study. From this analysis, two validation guidelines are recommended for use when evaluating estimates of body composition. When multicomponent models are used, it is essential that estimates of body water as a fraction of fat-free mass fall in the expected range (71 to 75%) and have a relatively small standard deviation (2 to 3%). For measuring changes in body composition, DXA estimates of total body mass must accurately reflect both baseline and posttreatment scale body weight estimates. Failure to meet these guidelines threatens the internal validity of the study and raises the likelihood of methodological discrepancies. Applying these criteria to DXA studies of body composition under review accounts for much of the contradictory conclusions among investigations.",ovid

Intraclass and Pearson's correlations between SMF-BIA and DXA were >0.92 in total body and >0.74 in regional measures. SMF-BIA underestimated percentage body fat (%BF) and fat mass (FM), and overestimated lean mass (LM) and percentage LM with significant offset trend bias.

Interestingly percentage offsets of fat content (%BF: 18.9/10.1%, FM: 18.8/11.1%) showed no significant bias trends indicating that the corresponding absolute methodological offset depends on the amount of fat content. The smallest percentage offset was found with LM: 4.3/0.1%, referring offset (LA) of 0.88/0.03 kg (+/-2.05/+/-1.71 kg). Correspondingly, segmental LM had poorer agreement than total body LM.

Subsegmental analysis was used to determine the bone distribution within the lumbar vertebrae., RESULTS: The lumbar spine bone mass was greater than the femoral neck as evidenced by the average lumbar spine and femoral neck T-scores, -0.493 and -1.81, and Z-scores, 1.70 and 0.12, respectively. There was also a significant correlation between the lumbar spine bone mineral density and femoral neck bone mineral density (r2 = 0.24, P < 0.0001).

We report on the assessment of an upgrade made to a Norland XR-26 dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) system. The upgraded version (2.3) consisted of new hip positioning aids, hip image analysis software and updates to the normal ranges. Measurements of femoral neck and trochanteric bone mineral density correlated well between versions (r = 0.969 and r = 0.971), those for femoral neck and trochanteric bone mineral content less well (r = 0.956 and r = 0.911), and Ward's triangle values and femoral neck area measurements were poorly correlated (r = 0.719-0.881). The upgrade was claimed to improve precision while reducing analysis and imaging time. Improved precision was not demonstrated, with good precision found both before and after the upgrade. Correlation between femoral neck Z-scores were good for the European normal range (r = 0.970), but unacceptable for the UK range (r = 0.769). These correlations were not close enough to allow patients scanned with the old version to be followed up with scans using the upgrade. The upgrade was, however, preferred for new attenders because of the improved speed and automation of hip analysis, without loss of precision. The most important implication in terms of patient management was the change made to the UK normal range, which had a very large effect on the number of patients deemed to be at risk from osteoporosis. It is essential that any upgrade introduced to an existing DXA system is carefully evaluated, since it may affect system performance and patient results.",ovid

Overall and regional body fat were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The associations of total and regional fat with apoB levels were evaluated using linear regression models. Following adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical risk factors, whole-body fat percentage was positively associated with apoB levels. Additionally, percent trunk fat was positively associated (highest vs. lowest tertile beta = 17.73 for men and 14.89 for women, respectively), whereas percent leg fat was inversely associated (highest vs. lowest tertile beta = - 4.84 for men and - 6.55 for women, respectively) with apoB levels in both sexes. The association for trunk fat and leg fat remained significant after further adjustment for body mass index or waist circumference. Higher percent trunk fat combined with lower percent leg fat was associated with particularly higher apoB.

Skeletal muscle, which constitutes the majority of lean soft tissue (LST) and appendicular lean soft tissue (ALST) when measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), represents a commonly used surrogate for strength. Research has investigated alternative measures of body composition, such as the assessment of ALST through bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and the determination of whole-body muscle mass from creatine pool size using the deuterated creatine (D3Cr) dilution method, for their associations to strength. While the relationship between body composition measures and strength has been studied in older adults, this relationship remains unexplored in athletic populations. This study examined muscle body composition measures using DXA, D3Cr, and BIA and their association with strength in a sample of collegiate athletes. The study enrolled 80 collegiate athletes (40 females) of differing sports disciplines who consumed a 60 mg dose of D3Cr and completed DXA and BIA measures in addition to trunk and leg strength tests. Analysis was sex-stratified using Pearson's correlations, linear regression, and quartile p trend significance. With an average participant age of 21.8 years, whole-body DXA correlations to muscle strength surpassed height- or mass-normalized values. This trend was especially pronounced in trunk strength's relationship with body composition over leg strength, across measurement methods. While DXA LST values were higher than BIA and D3Cr in predicting strength, the values did not differ significantly. Adjustments for age, BMI, and BIA variables didn't enhance this association. A significant trend between DXA LST and all strength measures underscored the equal relevance of DXA and D3Cr muscle mass to strength, favoring whole-body over regional assessments. This calls for future research on muscle mass's effects on LST and functional outcomes in broader groups, highlighting the importance of comprehensive body composition analysis in athletic performance studies.

We hypothesize this method will be related to muscle-specific strength measured by isokinetic dynamometry and explosive strength measured by jump mechanography. Nineteen NCAA Division I college athletes (10 women; age = 20.4 +/- 1.4 years; height = 1.8 +/- 0.1 m; body mass = 73.8 +/- 17.0 kg) underwent 3 DXA scans (1 total body, 2 lateral) and knee extension/flexion strength assessment using isokinetic dynamometry at 3 velocities (60, 120, and 180degree.s). A subset of 10 participants also completed a squat jump on a force platform on a different day. Pearson correlations compared 3 separate lean soft-tissue mass (LSTM) regions of interest (total leg, upper leg, and compartmental leg) with (a) isokinetic peak torque and (b) squat jump height, peak force, and peak and average rate of force development.

This study aimed to evaluate the consistency of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) compared with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for assessing BMC in healthy populations. Additionally, it explored the potential to improve prediction accuracy by optimizing regression equations tailored to specific age groups, providing valuable insights for skeletal health monitoring and personalized healthcare. A total of 302 healthy Korean participants (148 men and 154 women; mean ages 24.87 +/- 12.43 and 34.98 +/- 22.24 years, respectively) underwent body composition measurements via BIA and DXA. Basic variables such as age, height, and weight, along with a range of BIA parameters, were utilized to refine predictive models for BMC. Age-specific regression models significantly enhanced prediction accuracy, with the adjusted R2 reaching up to 0.90. The mean difference between the optimized BIA model and DXA was - 0.02 kg (p = 0.287), indicating negligible paired differences. In contrast, existing BIA equations exhibited substantial bias (mean difference up to 0.46 kg, p < 0.001). Age-related factors, particularly in older adults, likely contributed to the decline in predictive performance, with extracellular water (ECW) and total body water (TBW) identified as key variables in this subgroup. When using subject-specific equations, BIA demonstrated superior predictive capability for BMC compared to generalized equations. However, limitations include reliance on a single BIA device, lack of external validation, and an unbalanced age distribution, which may affect the generalizability of the findings. While DXA remains the gold standard, integrating BIA with optimized equations offers a portable and cost-effective alternative for skeletal health assessment and long-term monitoring in community settings. This study underscores the importance of developing BMC models tailored to specific populations to advance the precision and applicability of BIA methodologies across diverse age groups and demographic cohorts.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of malnutrition among patients listed for liver transplantation, as assessed by different methods, and also to relate dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to short-term post-transplant outcomes., METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed the medical records of 106 patients who underwent liver transplantation in 2009-2012. Body composition was assessed by the fat-free mass index (FFMI) and fat mass index (FMI) obtained using DXA. Severe infections within 1 month, length of stay in intensive care unit and length of hospital stay were endpoints of primary interest., RESULTS: The prevalence of malnutrition was 2-20% depending on sex and the assessment method. Thirty-nine (37%) patients developed severe infections within 1 month after liver transplantation. In multivariate analysis with logistic regression, body composition was significantly associated with post-operative infection when measured with FFMI (P = 0.043) but not with FMI (P = 0.087). Post-operative dialysis (P = 0.004) and post-operative infections (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with length of stay in hospital.

In general, multicompartment models with BIS or multifrequency BIA body water estimates produced more accurate body composition estimates than single assessment techniques (i.e., DXA, BIS, EIM, and BIA). Single assessment techniques produced low CE and TE for some body composition variables. However, proportional bias was observed for DXA and BIS.

Fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM) and percent body fat (%BF) were measured by ADP and compared to values determined by the DXA criterion. FFM from DXA was calculated as lean mass plus bone mineral content. A paired samples t-test was used to test for significant differences in the body composition variables between methods. A one-way ANOVA along with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), SEM,%SEM and MD was used to represent reliability., RESULTS: Validity data comparing ADP and DXA demonstrated no significant difference in FM (ADP-DXA FM = 0.99 kg; P = 0.113), FFM (0.98 kg; P = 0.115) and %BF (1.56%; P = 0.540). Reliability data for ADP between the first and second trials showed no significant difference in FM (P = 0.168; ICC = 0.994; SEM = 0.668), FFM (P = 0.058; ICC = 0.973; SEM = 0.892) or %BF (P = 0.121; ICC = 0.971; SEM = 0.813)., CONCLUSIONS: For overweight and obese women, ADP was found to be a valid measure of FM, FFM and %BF when compared with DXA.

The use of bioelectrical impedance (BIA) has increased recently since portable instruments make the measurements easy to execute and relatively inexpensive. The purpose of this study was to test the degree of relationship between FFM and fat mass calculated in elite female runners with 12 different BIA formulas reported in the literature and measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The present study shows that body composition by BIA is valid in female runners. Prediction equations used to calculate FFM and fat mass must be appropriate for this population subgroup and validated against other methods, such as DXA and hydrodensitometry. Those formulas that performed well in the controls gave poor results in the female runner and vice versa. The below average fat mass noted in female runners suggests that prediction equations for untrained women with average fat mass are inappropriate. The formula by RJL Systems-2 for women: FFM = 5.091 + 0.6483.height2/resistance + 0.1996.weight gave best predictions of FFM in female runners.

As ethanol can supply >50% of the dietary energy in alcoholics, body composition alterations may easily occur. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of chronic alcohol consumption on body composition in alcoholics compared to healthy social drinkers., METHODS: A total of 34 alcoholics defined according to DSM III R criteria, aged 41.6 +/- 9.3 yr and with a body mass index (BMI) 23.8 +/- 3.2 kg/m2, were consecutively enrolled in the study. In addition, 43 healthy male social drinkers were used as controls. Body composition was assessed using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and dietary habits were determined by a 3-day food diary., RESULTS: Mean daily alcohol intake was 194 +/- 62.4 g/day in alcoholics and 35.7 +/- 5.2 in healthy subjects (p < 0.0001). Body weight did not differ between alcoholics and controls (70.1 +/- 9.9 vs 71.8 +/- 6.4 kg). Alcoholics had a lower percent body fat (PBF) than control subjects (18.7 +/- 3.7 vs 23.9 +/- 3.9%; p < 0.01), as well as a lower fat mass content (13.4 +/- 3.8 vs 17.0 +/- 3.7 kg; p < 0.01). BMI was highly correlated with PBF in the patient population studied (R = 0.79; p < 0.0001). Significantly higher waist-to-hip ratios were found in alcoholics than in healthy subjects (p < 0.01). No correlation was found between dose of ethanol or duration of alcohol abuse and any of the variables examined., CONCLUSIONS: Alcoholics showed a reduced fat mass and a good preservation of lean body mass with respect to control subjects, and duration of alcohol use and alcohol dose did not seem to influence body composition.

Recently, significantly lower body weight (BW) and body mass index (BMI) were reported in males with AIS, and were thought to be related to curve progression. A case-control study was carried out to characterize the body composition and bone status of males with AIS, with the aim of gaining a better understanding of lower BW among these patients., METHODS: Forty-seven males with AIS and forty age- and gender-matched healthy controls were recruited. Standing height (SH) and BW were measured. The SH of the males who had AIS was corrected using Bjure's equation, and then the BMI was calculated. Body composition, including subcranial fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM), and bone mineral content (BMC), and bone mineral density (BMD) were analyzed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The LM index (LMi) and the FM index (FMi) were calculated by dividing the FM and LM by the square of the SH. Logistic regression analysis was employed for comparison between AIS and controls., RESULTS: The AIS patients had comparable age and Tanner staging for pubic hair as the controls. After adjustment for age, the AIS patients showed comparable SH but significantly lower BW and BMI than that of the controls. The LM, LMi, BMC and BMD were also significantly lower in the AIS patients than in the controls. However, the difference in BMC between two groups was not significant by adjusting for age, FM and LM., CONCLUSION: The male AIS patients showed abnormal body composition, presenting as significantly lower LM than the controls. The lower BMC observed in the patients might due to the abnormal body composition.",ovid

Anthropometric measurements, including total body weight and length, and regional measurements, including circumferences of head, chest, abdomen, midarm, and midthigh and dynamic skinfold thickness (15 and 60 s) at tricep, subscapular, suprailiac, and midthigh, were performed. Derived anthropometry included muscle and fat areas, and ratios were calculated from direct measurements. The skinfold thickness measurements between 15 and 60 s were highly correlated (r=0.973-0.996, p <0.001 for all comparisons). Strong correlations existed within the four circumferences of trunk and extremities, the four skinfolds, and the ratios of weight to length and its higher powers. Weight and length accounted for >97% of the variance of lean mass in AGA and SGA infants and 46% of the variance in LGA infants and for 80, 82, and 84% of the variance of fat mass in SGA, AGA, and LGA infants, respectively, whereas midarm:head circumference ratio and arm muscle and fat areas are the most important derived anthropometry in the prediction for body composition. They independently accounted for up to 16.5 and 10.2%, respectively, of the variance in body composition depending on the state of in utero growth. Thus, total body weight and length and some selected regional and derived anthropometry accounted for the vast majority of the variance of body composition.",ovid

The study was conducted from August to November 2008. Demographic data, clinical parameters, immunological status, and use of antiretroviral therapy were obtained from the patients' medical records. We performed anthropometric parameters and body composition analyses, analyzed body composition by BIA and DXA, and compared the results obtained from BIA through using equations for both healthy and HIV-infected populations., RESULTS: The mean +/- SD age of the study population was 9.8 +/- 1.2 years. Half of the population were females, and 82.5% of the children were clinically classified as B and C. Total body fat, by both absolute mass and by percentage, exhibited high homogeneity between the results obtained from BIA and DXA. However, there was no concordance in fat-free mass. The equation for healthy children showed good sensitivity and specificity when comparing the percentage of total body fat measured by DXA., CONCLUSION: BIA provides reliable data on total body fat but not fat-free mass when compared with DXA.

Therefore, the use of MF-BIA is validated in 77 RTx patients with a stable renal function at least 2 yr posttransplantation. MF-BIA is compared to isotope dilution techniques for measurement of body water compartments, and to dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and anthropometry for measurement of fat and fat free mass. Finally, DEXA and anthropometry are compared to each other. Method agreement is assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and plotted by Bland and Altman analysis. MF-BIA significantly underestimates total body water (TBW, 0.7+/-2.1 L) and overestimates the extracellular water (ECW, 3.3+/-1.8 L) compared to isotope dilution; the ICC between both techniques is 0.943 for TBW and 0.846 for ECW. The percentage body fat (BF) measured by MF-BIA is significantly higher than both BF measured by DEXA (3.4+/-4.7%) or by anthropometry (5.5+/-5.2%). The ICC between MF-BIA and DEXA is 0.887 and between MF-BIA and anthropometry 0.856. BF measured by DEXA is significantly higher than BF measured by anthropometry (2.1+/-4.4%); their ICC is 0.913. In conclusion, MF-BIA seems to be suitable for measurement of TBW in RTx patients; however, method agreement between isotope dilution and MF-BIA for the measurement of ECW is not satisfactory. In the assessment of fat and fat free mass, the reliability of MF-BIA appears to be questionable. Method agreement between DEXA and anthropometry seems to be slightly better.",ovid

A total of 537 adults (57.5% women), aged from 21 to 90 years, were recruited from the large north-eastern residential town of Yishun. Age- and sex-specific percentile reference values were generated for FMI, LMI, aLMI, Android/Gynoid % fat ratio and Trunk/Limb % fat ratio using the Lambda-Mu-Sigma method. The relationship between the parameters and age were assessed through the Pearson's correlation coefficient., RESULTS: All parameters demonstrated significant correlation with age (p < 0.05) for both men and women, except for LMI in women, with the strength of r ranging from 0.12 (weak correlation) to 0.54 (strong correlation). LMI (r = -0.45) and appendicular LMI (r = -0.54) were negatively associated with age in men while none (r = -0.06) to weak correlation (r = -0.14) were shown in women for the same parameters respectively.

Automated BIA devices provide an inexpensive and easy assessment of TBF, making them widely available to the general public and healthcare providers without specific qualification to assess body composition. The equations included in the automated BIA devices have been developed in very few specific populations, which means that they are not suitable to assess TBF for everyone and need to be validated before use in other populations. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the accuracy of the automated BIA device Tanita R BC-532 in youth of White European ethnicity, compared with the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), gold standard measurement of TBF., METHODS: Total body fat percentage (TBF%) was measured with the BIA device Tanita R BC-532 and DEXA (Hologic R QDR4500W) in 197 youth of White European ethnicity (N = 104 girls), 7-17 years old, and visiting the Diabetes & Endocrinology Care Paediatrics Clinic, Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg, for overweight or obesity management., RESULTS: TBF% evaluated with BIA was significantly correlated with TBF% measured with DEXA in both boys (r Pearson = 0.617) and girls (r Pearson = 0.648) (p < 10- 4). However, the residual mean between the assessment of TBF% by BIA and by DEXA [TBF BIA (%)-TBF DEXA (%)] is extremely high (mean +/- standard deviation = 10.52% +/- 5.22% in boys, respectively 9.96% +/- 4.40% in girls). The maximal absolute residual value is also very high, about 24% in both genders., CONCLUSIONS: The automated BIA device Tanita R BC-532 appears to be not accurate to assess total body fat in youth with overweight or obesity.

Diagnostic performance of BMI calculated from the MCH Handbook records to discriminate between the presence and absence of excessive adiposity at 14 years of age was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to quantify the diagnostic accuracy of BMI., RESULTS: With regard to the prediction of excessive fat at 14 years of age, AUCs and 95% confidence intervals for BMI at 1.5 and 3 years of age were greater than 0.5. Meanwhile, the AUC of BMI at birth was not significantly greater than 0.5., CONCLUSION: The present study findings indicate that BMI values calculated using MCH Handbook data have potential ability to distinguish between the presence and absence of excessive fat at 14 years of age.

JOUR,bone acquisition in healthy children and adolescents: comparisons of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography measures,DXA only,10.1210/jc.2004-1351,"['Wren, Tishya A L', 'Liu, Xiaodong', 'Pitukcheewanont, Pisit', 'Gilsanz, Vicente']",2005,"The effect that growth has on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) bone measurements is yet to be fully defined. The purpose of this study was to determine the best method for optimizing pediatric bone measurements using DXA. Height, weight, body mass index, skeletal age, and Tanner stage of sexual development were determined for 64 healthy boys and 60 healthy girls ages 6-17 yr. DXA of the lumbar vertebrae was performed to measure bone mineral content (BMC, grams) and areal bone mineral density (aBMD, grams per square centimeter), and geometric corrections were used to calculate volumetric bone mineral densities (vBMD): vBMD1 = aBMD/ radical(DXA-area) and vBMD2 = aBMD/bone height. Computed tomography (CT) imaging was performed to measure volumetric bone density (vBD) and vertebral volume (Vol) and to calculate CT-BMC = vBD * Vol. Linear regression was used to compare DXA-BMC vs. CT-BMC and CT vBD vs. DXA aBMD, vBMD1, and vBMD2. Multiple regression including the anthropometric and developmental parameters was also performed. DXA and CT BMC were highly correlated (r2= 0.94). However, DXA aBMD correlated more strongly with CT Vol (r2= 0.68) than with CT density (r2= 0.39), and calculation of DXA volumetric densities only slightly improved the density correlations (r2= 0.49 for vBMD1; r2= 0.55 for BMD2). The correlations for density were particularly poor for subjects in Tanner stages 1-3 (r2= 0.02 for aBMD; r2= 0.13 for vBMD1; r2= 0.27 for vBMD2). In contrast, multiple regression accounting for the anthropometric and developmental parameters greatly improved the agreement between the DXA and CT densities (r2= 0.91). These results suggest that DXA BMC is a more accurate and reliable measure than DXA BMD for assessing bone acquisition, particularly for prepubertal children and those in the early stages of sexual development. Use of DXA BMD would be reasonable if adjustments for body size, pubertal status, and skeletal maturity are made, but these additional assessments add significant complexity to the studies.",ovid

Acid-base balance was assessed by arterial blood gas analysis. Bone mineral status was measured by urinary pyridinium cross-links and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. In addition, urinary deoxypyridinoline was measured in 79 patients., RESULTS: Of the 46 patients 7 (15%) with the Kock pouch (1), Indiana pouch (5) and ileal conduit (1) had metabolic acidosis associated with significantly lower bone mineral densities (p < 0.05) and higher urinary pyridinium cross-links (p < 0.005) than did those with normal acid-base status. No difference was found in metabolic acidosis and bone demineralization among the 3 groups. Additionally, in 79 patients urinary deoxypyridinoline reached the highest level immediately postoperatively and then gradually decreased to the stable level within 1 or 2 years., CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic acidosis following urinary intestinal diversion results in bone demineralization. The types of diversion did not cause differences in metabolic acidosis and bone resorption. Bone has a major role in buffering acid overload in the early postoperative period.",ovid

The purpose of this study was to determine the fracture rate after kidney transplantation and the significance of osteodensitometry with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in identifying the risk patients. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured with DXA in 100 graft recipients (mean interval 63 +/- 53 months after transplantation) and correlated with the incidence of fractures. Fracture rate of peripheral bones increased from 0.009 before transplantation and 0.012 on hemodialysis to 0.032 fractures per patient and year after transplantation. Seventeen fractures of peripheral bones occurred in 11% of the patients within a mean of 103 +/- 59 months after transplantation. Three additional patients had fractures of the lumbar spine. Patients with fractures were characterized by low or low-normal BMD (0.93 +/- 0.23 versus 1.04 +/- 0.17 g/cm2 at lumbar spine), a frequent history of parathyroidectomy (21% versus 6%), and a longer transplant interval (103 +/- 59 versus 57 +/- 49 months). Fractures occurred in patients with low and normal BMD. DXA at the femoral neck proved to be of no value to define patients at risk of fractures. DXA at the lumbar spine also proved to be of limited value for this question. Therefore, alternatively, more sensitive methods of BMD and of bone architecture measurements are necessary for identifying the kidney transplant recipients at risk of fracture.",ovid

This study aimed to understand rates of bone health screening adherence, describe factors associated with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) acquisition, and identify factors associated with abnormal DXA., METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of pediatric IBD patients over a 10-year time frame. We included IBD patients (2-20 years of age) enrolled in ImproveCareNow and excluded patients with primary metabolic bone disease. Time-to-event methods and multivariable logistic regression were employed to identify factors associated with DXA acquisition and abnormal DXA., RESULTS: In 676 patients, 464 (68.63%) pediatric patients with IBD had a risk factor for low bone mineral density (BMD); 137 (29.53%) underwent an initial DXA scan. Quiescent disease was significantly associated with a reduced likelihood of DXA (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.24-0.97), while weight z-score <-2 was significantly associated with DXA performance (HR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.08-3.98). Abnormal DXA results (BMD z-score <=-1) occurred in 59 (35.54%) individuals. After adjusting for visit diagnosis, delayed puberty, severe disease course, 6 months or greater of steroid exposure, and history of fracture, BMI z-score <-1 (odds ratio: 5.45; 95% CI: 2.41-12.33) was associated with abnormal DXA., CONCLUSIONS: DXA screening occurred in less than one-third of eligible pediatric IBD patients. Compliance was more common in patients with a weight z-score <-2 and less common in those with quiescent disease. BMI strongly predicted abnormal DXA results when adjusting for risk factors for abnormal BMD.

JOUR,bone homogeneity factor: an advanced tool for the assessment of osteoporotic bone structure in high-resolution magnetic resonance images,DXA only,10.1097/01.RLI.0000068412.46,"['Langenberger, Herbert', 'Shimizu, Yu', 'Windischberger, Christian', 'Grampp, Stephan', 'Berg, Andreas', 'Ferlitsch, Katrin', 'Moser, Ewald']",2003,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass and inferior structural competence. In this study we introduce the bone homogeneity factor (BHF) as a quantitative measurement of bone structure, which could be equally important as bone mineral density., METHODS: BHF represents an advanced texture analysis tool based on the spatial autocorrelation function calculated in 9 different directions. These calculations were performed on high-resolution magnetic resonance images of the calcaneus at 3.0 T and compared with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry measurements of the femoral neck., RESULTS: The quality and resolution of the high-resolution magnetic resonance images is sufficient for reliably calculating BHF. The mean BHF of the control group (n = 5, mean BHF = 525,0) with normal bone is significantly (P = 0.009, Mann-Whitney U test) higher than in the osteoporotic group (n = 7, mean BHF = 137,8). The BHF correlates with the DXA measurements of the femoral neck (correlation coefficient = 0.75)., CONCLUSIONS: By calculating the BHF, it was possible to distinguish between osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic bone structure. Hence, BHF could be a possible candidate for noninvasive assessment of osteoporotic bone structure giving additional information to routinely used bone mineral densitometry.",ovid

Of these, 166 patients were evaluated longitudinally. Data were compared with two age- and sex-matched control groups., RESULTS: In comparison with controls, JIA patients, but not with ERA, had a reduced spine bone-mineral apparent density (BMAD) standard deviation score (P < 0.001) and musculoskeletal deficits, with significantly lower levels of trabecular bone mineral density (TrabBMD) (P < 0.0001), muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) (P < 0.005), and density-weighted polar section modulus (SSIp) (P < 0.05). In contrast, JIA showed fat CSA significantly higher than controls (P < 0.0001). Finally, JIA patients had a significant reduced amplitude-dependent speed of sound (AD-SoS) (P < 0.001), and QUS z score (P < 0.005)., CONCLUSIONS: JIA patients have a low bone mass that, after a first increase due to the therapy, does not reach the normal condition over time. The pronounced bone deficits in JIA are greater than would be expected because of reduction in muscle cross-sectional area. Thus, bone alterations in JIA likely represent a mixed defect of bone accrual and lower muscle forces.",ovid

Traditionally, bone mineral assessment by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) involves comparison to age- and gender-matched reference ranges, and these studies in children with IBD show a high prevalence of osteopenia., AIMS: To compare the prevalence of osteopenia using two methods of interpretation; one adjusted for age and gender and the other adjusted for bone size and gender., PATIENTS: Forty-seven patients with Crohn disease (CD) and 26 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) with a median age of 13.5 years (range, 5.5-18.2 years) were evaluated., METHODS: Lumbar spine (LS) and total body (TB) bone mineral content (BMC) were measured by DXA and converted to bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm) corresponding to BMC divided by the bone area. Age and gender-matched BMD standard deviation scores (SDS) were based on reference data providing age- and gender-matched BMC and bone area. These data also allowed calculation of percentage of predicted bone area for age and gender (ppBone Area) and percentage of predicted BMC for Bone Area (ppBMC)., RESULTS: Patients with CD were shorter than those with UC (median height, SDS, -0.9 v 0, P < 0.05). Median ppBone Area for LS and TB for the whole group was 85% (10th centile, 68; 90th centile 99) and 81% (10th centile 66; 90th centile, 97), respectively. The ppBone Area at both sites was directly related to height SDS and BMI SDS (r > 0.5; P < 0.005). Median BMD SDS for LS and TB was -1.6 (10th centile -3.6; 90th centile, -0.2) and -0.9 (10th centile, -2.4; 90th centile, 0.4), respectively. Median ppBMC for LS and TB was 98% (10th centile, 84%; 90th centile, 113%) and 101% (10th centile 94%; 90th centile, 107%), respectively. The ppBMC showed no relationship to ppBone Area (r = 0.1, NS). Failure to account for bone area led to a label of moderate or severe osteopenia in 65% of cases. After adjustment for bone area, the proportion of children with osteopenia fell to 22%., CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that children with IBD often have small bones for age because they have growth retardation.",ovid

While several factors may lead to low BMD in these patients, the value of BMD measurements in rheumatic patients with end-stage OA scheduled for total joint arthroplasty is unknown., METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study of 50 adults with secondary OA due to rheumatic diseases, we evaluated dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements of both hips and the spine performed within 3 months prior to arthroplasty (n = 25 total hip arthroplasty, THA; n = 25 total knee arthroplasty, TKA). We analyzed various demographic and disease-specific characteristics and their effect on DXA results by using group comparisons and multivariate linear regression models., RESULTS: Although patients undergoing TKA were younger (63.2 +/- 14.2 vs. 71.0 +/- 10.8 yr., p = 0.035), osteoporosis was observed more frequently in patients scheduled for TKA than THA (32% vs. 12%). Osteopenia was detected in 13/25 patients (52%) in both the THA and TKA cohort. In the THA cohort, female sex, lower BMI and prednisolone use were associated with lower T-score in the hip. In TKA patients, higher OA grade determined by Kellgren-Lawrence score was associated with lower T-score in the hip of the affected side., CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporosis is present in a considerable frequency of rheumatic patients with end-stage OA, and THA and TKA patients show distinct frequencies and risk factors of low BMD.

Ninety-five women who had had BMDo during the last 12 months were selected. L2-L4 BMD was measured twice on the same day using both DPA (BMDp) and by DXA (BMDx).

It thus allows the earliest possible diagnosis of osteopenia, with consequent prompt estimation of fracture risk. However, for proper evaluation of densitometry results it is essential that a comparison with reference BMD values of normal age- and sex-matched persons from the same population be performed. For this purpose we determined bone density of the L2-L4 vertebrae, the L3 vertebra in the lateral projection, the proximal femur and the os calcis in a cross-sectional study of 168 men and 244 women from the Greek population. The age range of the subjects was 20-80 years. Peak bone mass for both sexes was attained in the 30-35 year age group for the vertebrae and in the 25-30 year age group for the proximal femur and os calcis. Mean annual vertebral bone loss calculated on cross-sectional data ranged from 0.1% to 0.22% for women < 50 years and from 1.3% to 1.6% for those > 50 years, whereas in men the range was from 0.36% to 0.64% for the whole age spectrum.

Twenty-seven patients (17 with severe hemophilia; residual factor activity <1% and 10 with moderate hemophilia) participated in the study. Mean age was 12.28+/-4.48 y (range: 4.94 to 18.00 y). All patients were evaluated with QUS at radius and at tibia and had DXA scan at lumbar spine. Anthropometric parameters were measured using standard techniques and joint evaluation was carried out using the Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS). Only 2 out of 27 patients (7.5%) had BMD Z-scores <-2, whereas another 4 patients (15%) had BMD Z-scores between -1 and -2. QUS values in both radius and tibia were generally within the normal limits as only 1 patient had radius and another 1 had tibia QUS Z-score <-2. HJH scores were significantly although negatively correlated to Z-scores of tibia QUS (r=-0.455, P=0.034). No correlations were observed between lumbar BMD and radius or tibia QUS and no agreement was recorded between QUS and DXA in identifying patients at risk for osteoporosis (k=0.262).

The aim of the study was to investigate whether dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is of value to predict fractures. In 1995-2007, 238 renal transplant patients underwent 670 DXA investigations. Osteopenia (46.0%), osteoporosis (13.9%) and absolute bone mineral density (BMD) (median 0.9, range 0.4-2.0 g/cm(2)) in the hip region were used to evaluate fracture risk. Data on fractures were collected at the occasion of each DXA, and a questionnaire was filled in by 191 patients at regular outpatient visits. Reported fractures were verified by consultation of medical records. In all, 46 patients had 53 fractures. Cumulative hazard of fracture was significantly different among normal BMD, osteopenia and osteoporosis in the hip (p < 0.0001). A Cox proportional hazard analysis also including age, gender and diabetic nephropathy showed significantly increased fracture risk for osteoporosis (3.5 times, CI 1.8-6.4, p = 0.0001) as well as for osteopenia (2.7 times, 1.6-4.6, p = 0.0003). A significantly increased risk was also found with absolute BMD estimates below the median. Osteopenia and an absolute bone density below 0.9 g/cm(2) in the hip region confer an increased risk of fracture.",ovid
JOUR,changes in bone mineral density at the proximal tibia after total knee arthroplasty: a 2-year follow-up of 28 knees using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry,DXA only,10.1002/jor.1100180107,"['Li, M G', 'Nilsson, K G']",2000,"The change in bone mineral density at the proximal tibia during 2 years after total knee arthroplasty was studied in 28 knees (28 patients: 10 men and 18 women; median age: 71 years) with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Bone mineral density was measured at the proximal tibia at nine regions of interest below the tibial component within 1 week after the operation (baseline); measurements were repeated at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. All but one knee was malaligned before the operation, and all but three were corrected to within the normal range of alignment after it. The mean bone mineral density of all nine regions of interest at the proximal tibia temporarily decreased by 13% (p = 0.001) during the initial 3 months, probably due to a general metabolic reaction of the skeleton to the operative trauma combined with the effect of the postoperative immobilization, and then the initial level was regained for as long as 2 years. The overall changes in mean bone mineral density to 2 years were insignificant (p > 0.05); however, a great variation (43.9% decrease to 98.0% increase) was observed on an individual basis. This change over time was significantly associated (R2 = 0.36, p = 0.002) with the level of the baseline bone mineral density, which in turn was partly related (R2 = 0.24, p = 0.009) to the amount of malalignment of the knee before the operation. Knees with high baseline levels (n = 14: 11 with varus and three with valgus alignment) displayed a decrease of 10.0 +/- 14.0% (mean +/- SD, p > 0.05) for as long as 2 years, whereas those with low baseline levels (n = 14: seven with varus and six with valgus alignment and one neutrally aligned) had an increase of 19.1 +/- 38.2% (p = 0.038).

Androgen deprivation significantly decreased bone mineral density either at the lumbar spine (mean gm./cm.2 [SD] 1.00 [0.194], 0.986 [0.172] and 0.977 [0.182] at baseline, and 6 and 12 months, respectively, p <0.002) or the hip (0.929 [0.136], 0.926 [0.144] and 0.923 [0.138], p <0.03). A more than 2% decrease in bone mineral density was found at the lumbar spine in 19 men (54.3%) and at the hip in 15 (42.9%). Bone mineral content paralleled the bone mineral density pattern.

At transplant, spine-BMD Z-scores were greater in younger recipients (<13 years), versus 898 reference participants (p < 0.001). In multivariate models, greater decreases in spine-BMD Z-scores were associated with greater glucocorticoid dose (p < 0.001) and declines in parathyroid hormone levels (p = 0.008). Changes in DXA spine-BMD and QCT trabecular BMD were correlated (r = 0.47, p < 0.01). At 12 months, spine-BMD Z-scores remained elevated in younger recipients, but did not differ in older recipients (>= 13) and reference participants. Baseline WB-BMC Z-scores were significantly lower than reference participants (p = 0.02). Greater glucocorticoid doses were associated with declines in WB-BMC Z-scores (p < 0.001) while greater linear growth was associated with gains in WB-BMC Z-scores (p = 0.01). Changes in WB-BMC Z-scores were associated with changes in tibia cortical area Z-scores (r = 0.52, p < 0.001), but not changes in cortical BMD Z-scores. Despite resolution of muscle deficits, WB-BMC Z-scores at 12 months remained significantly reduced.

Age, sex, screening year (index year), and Charlson comorbidity index of the DXA and non-DXA groups were matched using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) for propensity score analysis. For cost-effectiveness analysis, a societal perspective, 1-year cycle length, 20-year time horizon, and discount rate of 2% per year for both effectiveness and costs were adopted in the incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) model., RESULTS: The outcome analysis included 10337 patients (female:male, 63.8%:36.2%) who were screened for osteoporosis in southern Taiwan between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2021. The DXA group had significantly better outcomes than the non-DXA group in terms of fragility fractures (7.6% vs. 12.5%, P < 0.001) and mortality (0.6% vs. 4.3%, P < 0.001). The DXA screening strategy gained an ICER of US$ -2794 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) relative to the non-DXA at the willingness-to-pay threshold of US$ 33004 (Taiwan's per capita gross domestic product). The ICER after stratifying by ages of 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and >= 80 years were US$ -17815, US$ -26862, US$ -28981, and US$ -34816 per QALY, respectively., CONCLUSION: Using DXA to screen adults aged 50 years or older for osteoporosis resulted in a reduced incidence of fragility fractures, lower mortality rate, and reduced total costs. Screening for osteoporosis is a cost-saving strategy and its effectiveness increases with age. However, caution is needed when generalizing these cost-effectiveness results to all older populations because the study population consisted mainly of women.

The accuracy and precision of the method in clinical patient populations have not been firmly established. This study sought to establish the short-term reproducibility of measurements made with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry of multiple sites in a large sample of elderly patients with rheumatic disease. Reproducibility was assessed in the lumbar spine and in three femoral sites in 69 patients participating in a longitudinal clinical trial. In each patient, absorptiometry was performed twice in the same day at as many as five time points over a 2-year period. The mean (+/- SD) baseline bone density was 0.783 +/- 0.128 g/cm2 for the femoral neck and 1.015 +/- 0.218 g/cm2 for the lumbar spine. The correlations between the duplicate baseline measurements of the spine were excellent (r = 0.9936, p < 0.001) and were stable over the 2-year period; the mean difference between the duplicate baseline measurements was 1.82 +/- 1.54% and the mean coefficient of variation was 1.29%.

In order to validate this technique, results from DEXA were compared with fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) measured by total body levels of potassium (TBK), nitrogen (TBN), water (TBW) and carbon (TBC)., METHODS: A healthy population of 127 white women and 38 black women with a body mass index of 18-30 were recruited., RESULTS: Compared with each of the other methods, DEXA overestimated FM and underestimated FFM. The slopes of the FM by DEXA versus the FM from each of the four methods were approximately the same, with a s.e.e. ranging from 2.4 to 3.0 units. The slopes of DEXA in comparison to FFM, however, ranged from 0.61 to 0.74 and were significantly less than unity, with a s.e.e. of 1.6 to 2.4 units., CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that at high values of FFM, DEXA is measuring something different from the FFM measured by TBW, TBN and TBK. The program for separating bone and soft tissue and for separating soft tissue into fat and lean at higher values in the DEXA method may need to be adjusted.",ovid

This study examined those features using morphometric texture analysis in chest computational tomography (CT) by comparing a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-based BMC. An accessible approach for screening osteoporosis was suggested by accessing BMC using only Hounsfield units (HU)., METHODOLOGY: The study included a total of 510 cases (255 patients) acquired between May 6, 2012, and June 30, 2020, at a single institution. Two cases were associated with two chest CT scans from one patient with a scan interval of over two years, and each scan was followed soon after by a DXA scan. Axial cuts of the first lumbar vertebra in CT and DXA-based L1 BMC values were corrected for each case. The maximum trabecular area was selected from the L1 spine body, and 45 texture features were extracted from the region using gray-level co-occurrence matrices. A regression model was employed to estimate the absolute BMC value in each case using 45 features. Also, an additional regression model was used to estimate the change in BMC between two scans for each patient using 90 features from the corresponding cases., RESULTS: The correlation coefficient (CC) and mean absolute error (MAE) between estimates and DXA references were obtained for the evaluation of regressors. In the case of the BMC estimation, CC and MAE were 0.754 and 1.641 (g). In the case of the estimation of change in BMC, CC and MAE were 0.680 and 0.528 (g)., CONCLUSION: The modality using morphometric texture analysis with CT HUs can indirectly help screening osteoporosis because it provides estimates of BMC and BMC change that show moderate positive correlations with DXA measures.

The Bland-Altman analysis showed the mean differences (DXA-SF) of BF% were positive for female (8.74%) and male (7.22%), suggesting Jackson & Pollock 7-site skinfold equation tends to underestimate the BF%. Besides, regional SF thicknesses of 7-site skinfold measurement were significantly correlated with the matched regional adiposity quantified by DXA. Furthermore, truncal and android SF thicknesses were notably positively correlated with several cardiometabolic risk factors in gender-specific manner. Our data indicate the 7-site skinfold measurement is not an interchangeable method for precisely measuring BF%, but might be practical for evaluating the cardiometabolic risks in Taiwanese diabetic outpatients.",ovid

Bland-Altman plots revealed significant fixed systematic and negative proportional biases for body composition variables-both for the direct comparisons (e.g., total LBM, 1.2 kg higher with DF-BIA, p < .05, n = 31) and for monitoring (total LBM, kg; men [n = 15]: DXA [0.96 +/- 2.61] vs. DF-BIA [-0.35 +/- 3.52] and women [n = 16]: DXA [-0.39 +/- 1.51] vs. DF-BIA [-1.05 +/- 2.24]). Generally, correlations for direct comparisons were higher than for monitoring (R2 ; 0.870, 0.947 vs. 0.048, 0.717 [head region not included], n = 31)., CONCLUSION: DF-BIA and DXA cannot be used interchangeably in geriatric medical patients. However, high replicability shows that both methods may be used for monitoring under standardized conditions. Results indicate gender-specific differences, and segmental analysis can only be recommended with DXA using clear anatomical references.

Body density estimated from the BOD POD (1.04657 +/- 0.01825 g/cc) was significantly higher than that estimated from HW (1.04032 +/- 0.01872 g/cc). The relative body fat calculated from the BOD POD (23.12 +/- 8.39 %BF) was highly correlated but, on average, 2.9% BF lower than %BF DXA. Average %BF estimates from HW and DXA were not significantly different. Despite consistently underestimating the %BF of children, the strong relationship between DXA and the BOD POD suggests that further investigation may improve the accuracy of the BOD POD for assessing body composition in children.",ovid

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is an easy and non-invasive technique, but has limitations in underweight and overweight subjects. Few reports have investigated the validity of BIA in children. In this report, the characteristics of BIA, especially in overweight and underweight children, are assessed and the results are compared with those of dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), as a reliable method for assessing body composition., METHODS: Determination of the fat-free mass (FFM), body fat content and percent body fat (%fat) was carried out using both BIA and DXA. The subjects (60 males and 44 females) were divided into five groups according to the percentage of ideal bodyweight (%IBW). Ten obese children, who were treated with exercise and a low-energy diet for 1 month, were also enrolled in this study., RESULTS: The %fat, FFM and body fat content showed a close correlation when measured by BIA and DXA with the correlation coefficients being 0.90, 0.95, and 0.95, respectively. In the underweight group, the %fat value determined by BIA tended to be greater than that determined by DXA, while in the overweight group, the BIA value was lower than the DXA value. The same trend was also seen in obese children before and after therapy with exercise and diet., CONCLUSION: Bioelectrical impedance analysis seems to be a reasonable method for daily clinical use, but attention should be paid to the interpretation of %fat values in underweight and overweight children.",ovid

The aims of this study were to evaluate the applicability of different BIA equations on FFM in Chinese subjects, and to compare the difference in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients with healthy controls respectively., METHODS: Dialysis patients and healthy adults were enrolled in this study, and the subjects were matched by age, gender, and the minimum sample size in each group was calculated using PASS. FFM estimated by BIA was calculated using equations of Kyle, Sun SS and Segal, and TBW/0.73. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) method was set as reference method. Pearson's correlation and Bland-Altman analysis were used to test the validity of the BIA equations., RESULTS: 50 hemodialysis (HD) patients, 52 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and 30 healthy adults aged 22-67 y were included in this study. Age, height, weight, BMI and gender did not differ significantly among HD, PD patients, and healthy controls (p > 0.05), but BIA parameters were quite different (p<0.01). Bland-Altman analysis showed that in healthy volunteers, all equations showed good agreement with DXA measured. For dialysis patients, the FFM predictions of different equations showed differences between HD and PD patients, and the equations seemed more applicable for HD patients., CONCLUSION: The equations developed by healthy subjects might be not appropriate for dialysis patients, especially peritoneal dialysis patients.

Thus, the primary objectives were to determine the relationship between lean and fat mass, and body fat percentage (BF%) with BMI, and assess the agreement between BMI and BF% in defining obesity., METHODS: Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 462 males (20-91 years old) who currently or previously served in the U.S. Navy. A BMI of >= 30 kg/m2 and a BF% >= 25% were used for obesity classification., RESULTS: The mean BMI (+/- SD) and BF% were 28.8 +/- 4.1 and 28.9 +/- 6.6%, respectively, with BF% increasing with age. Lean mass, fat mass, and BF% were significantly correlated with BMI for all age groups. The exact agreement of obesity defined by BMI and BF% was fair (61%), however, 38% were misclassified by a BMI cut-off of 30 when obesity was defined by BF%., CONCLUSIONS: From this data we determined that there is a good correlation between body composition and BMI, and fair agreement between BMI and BF% in classifying obesity in a group of current and former U.S. Navy service members.

The standard method, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), is hardly feasible in routine clinical practice contrary to Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) method. We thus aimed to compare body composition assessment by DXA and BIA according to the body mass index (BMI) in a large cohort., METHODS: Retrospectively, we analysed DXA and BIA measures in patients followed in a Nutrition Unit from 2010 to 2016. Body composition was assessed under standardized conditions in the morning, after a fasting period of 12 h, by DXA (Lunar Prodigy Advance) and BIA (Bodystat QuadScan 4000, Manufacturer's equation). Bland-Altman test was performed for each class of BMI (kg/m2) and fat mass and fat free mass values were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test. Pearson correlations were also performed and the concordance coefficient of Lin was calculated., RESULTS: Whatever the BMI, BIA and DXA methods reported higher concordance for values of FM than FFM. Body composition values were very closed for patients with BMI between 16 and 18,5 (difference < 1kg). For BMI > 18,5 and BMI < 40, BIA overestimated fat free mass from 3,38 to 8,28 kg, and underestimated fat mass from 2,51 to 5,67 kg compared with DXA method. For BMI >= 40, differences vary with BMI. For BMI < 16, BIA underestimated fat free mass by 2,25 kg, and overestimated fat mass by 2,57 kg. However, limits of agreement were very large either for FM and FFM values, irrespective of BMI., CONCLUSION: The small bias, particularly in patients with BMI between 16 and 18, suggests that BIA and DXA methods are interchangeable at a population level. However, concordance between BIA and DXA methods at the individual level is lacking, irrespective of BMI.",ovid

The aim was to compare nutrition status indicators using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as reference in HD patients., METHODS: Observational cross-sectional study with 42 patients, 55.8 years (+/-14.6) old, 60% male, HD 2-3 times per week for >=3 months. HD ranged from 3 months to 28 years (median, 17.3; interquartile range, 8.73-39.0). We used body mass index (BMI) and fat mass (FM) by skinfold thickness (SFT), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and DXA. Statistical analyses used Bland-Altman plots, Lin's concordance correlation coefficient, the paired t-test, and Pearson or Spearman correlation. P < .05 was significant., RESULTS: SFT and DXA presented the lowest prevalence of malnutrition (2.4%) and BMI the highest (28.6%). BMI, BIA FM, and SFT FM presented strong positive correlations with DXA FM (r = 0.915; r = 0.976; r = 0.910, P < .001, respectively). BIA FM and fat-free mass (FFM) demonstrated substantial agreement with DXA values (rho = 0.974 and 0.960, P < .001). Thus, the measurement procedures used, SFT and BIA, underestimated %FM (-4.65% and -2.13%) and overestimated FFM (3.12 kg and 1.0 kg) according to DXA. No differences were found between mean values of BIA FM and DXA (P = .178)., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with DXA, BIA was the most appropriate nutrition indicator for measuring body composition.

QUS parameters of the calcaneus (broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), bone velocity (BV), and speed of sound (SOS)) were measured by a Walker Sonix UBA 575+. Bone mineral density (BMD; g x cm(-2)) of the lumbar spine, hip (femoral neck, trochanter, Ward's triangle) and whole body was assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Hologic QDR 1000/W). Data analysis included unpaired two-tailed Student's t-tests, analysis of variance, Pearson product-moment, and Spearman rank-order correlations., RESULTS: Regional and whole body BMD of gymnasts was greater than controls (P < 0.001), with the difference being 7-28%. Average QUS parameters of the right and left calcaneus were also higher (P < 0.001) in the gymnasts. BUA, BV, and SOS were significantly (P < 0.001) correlated to each bone site with r = 0.54-0.79. Analysis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicated no significant difference in sensitivity and specificity for QUS and DXA measures., CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that QUS parameters of the calcaneus are higher in young women gymnasts compared to individuals who undergo regular weight-bearing activity and that QUS parameters are able to discriminate between these two groups in a similar manner as does regional and whole body BMD.",ovid

The % body fat prediction was compared with DXA through a Bland-Altman Plot with +/-2-4% body fat established as a zone of agreement (ZOA). Thirteen out of 23 cadets fell outside the ZOA. No cadet was over the compliance threshold (20-22% fat) using the tape method, however, with DXA, 7 out of 23 cadets were noncompliant. Height-weight tables provided a moderate level of categorical agreement with DXA. The results depict poor agreement between taping and DXA, as taping generally underestimated % body fat. Compared with taping, height-weight tables were better able to identify excess fat weight.",ovid

However, studies that validate the accuracy of BIA exclusively in post-menopausal women are lacking. The main purpose of the present study was to evaluate the agreement of multi-frequency (MF)-BIA and single-frequency (SF)-BIA with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in the estimation of fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) among post-menopausal women with variation in body mass index (BMI) and physical activity (PA)., METHODS: FM and FFM were estimated by BIA and DXA in 146 post-menopausal women with a mean (SD) age of 62.8 (5.2) years. PA was determined by an accelerometer., RESULTS: The mean (SD) difference between MF-BIA and DXA was -1.8 (1.8) kg (P = 0.08) and 1.3 (1.8) kg (P = 0.01) for FM and FFM, respectively. SF-BIA provided a significantly lower estimate of FM [-2.0 (2.2) kg; P = 0.04] and a higher estimate of FFM [1.8 (2.4) kg; P < 0.01] compared to DXA. MF-BIA provided significantly better estimates of FM and FFM with narrower limits of agreement than SF-BIA in obese and insufficiently active subjects. In other BMI and PA groups, both BIA devices showed a similar deviation from DXA., CONCLUSIONS: BIA tends to underestimate FM and overestimate FFM relative to DXA. MF-BIA appears to be a more appropriate method for the assessment of body composition than SF-BIA in post-menopausal woman with BMI >30 kg/m(2) and in those who are insufficiently active.

Twenty-one young male volunteers (mean +/- SD; age = 22.9 +/- 3.0 years; height = 175.5 +/- 5.9 cm; body mass = 82.9 +/- 13.6 kg; body mass index = 26.9 +/- 3.6) performed an RT program that included exercises for all major muscle groups. Body composition was assessed using both methods before and after the intervention; change scores were determined by subtracting pre-test values from post-test values for percent body fat ([INCREMENT]%BF), fat mass ([INCREMENT]FM), and fat-free mass ([INCREMENT]FFM). Mean changes were not significantly different when comparing MF-BIA with DXA for [INCREMENT]%BF (-1.05 vs. -1.28%), [INCREMENT]FM (-1.13 vs. -1.19 kg), and FFM (0.10 vs. 0.37 kg, respectively).

The 2 methods were poor predictors of each other in regards to changes in segmental measurements.

A woman was considered eligible for fracture prevention therapy if she had a T-score <=-2.5 at the femoral neck and/or the lumbar vertebrae (two to four) or at least one vertebral fracture of >=20% deformity., RESULTS: Seven hundred and forty-six women (37.6%) met the new criteria as a case for PBS-subsidised fracture prevention therapy. Four hundred and thirty-one (21.7%) had a T-score <=-2.5 on DXA compared with 10.6% (n = 210) with a T-score <=-3.0. Four hundred and eighty-three (24.4%) had at least one vertebral fracture. Only 8.5% (n = 168) had both a T-score <=-2.5 and a prevalent vertebral fracture. The cost per case found by DXA equated to $460 compared with $398 for screening by thoracolumbar X-ray., CONCLUSIONS: The use of either DXA or X-ray will identify approximately two-thirds of women aged 70 years and over who would be eligible for fracture prevention. The use of X-ray would identify a marginally larger number of women and at lower financial cost but involve substantially greater radiation exposure.

Measures of regional obesity may be used to predict insulin resistance. In the present study we compared fat distribution in patients with PCOS vs. controls and established the best measure of fat mass to predict insulin resistance in patients with PCOS., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was cross-sectional in an academic tertiary-care medical center with 167 premenopausal women with PCOS and 110 controls matched for ethnicity, BMI and age. Total and regional fat and lean body mass were assessed by whole body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. Anthropometric measures (BMI, waist) and fasting metabolic analyses [insulin, glucose, lipids, Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), lipid accumulation product, and visceral adiposity index] were determined.

Body fat assessment was performed by the SKF, BIA and DEXA methods after a haemodialysis session. Analysis of variance, intra-class correlation coefficient and Bland and Altman plot analysis were used for comparative analysis among the methods., RESULTS: Body fat estimates by SKF (17.7 +/- 7.8 kg) and BIA (18.6 +/- 9.2 kg) were not significantly different from those obtained by DEXA (18.2 +/- 7.9 kg) considering the whole population. However, the BIA technique worked differently from DEXA when analysed by gender, measuring less fat content in men and higher fat content in women (P < 0.01). No differences were observed for SKF. Strong intra-class correlation coefficients (r) were found between DEXA with SKF (r = 0.94) and BIA (r = 0.91).

In the control group, mean percentage of fat mass measured by SFT was significantly higher than measured by DXA ( P = .004). Mean difference was 1.99% +/- 3.65%. The measurements of body fat performed by BIS were significantly higher than those performed by DXA in all studied groups ( P < .001). Age was statistically significant and the strongest factor that influenced the variability of measurements obtained by BIS and DXA in all studied groups ( R2 = 0.302, 0.153, and 0.250, respectively, for HD, PreD, and control groups)., CONCLUSIONS: SFT as a method of fat mass assessment in daily routine practice seems to be more reliable then BIS in patients treated with hemodialysis and in patients with stage IV/V CKD. However, methods based on bioimpedance techniques can potentially offer more data such as overhydration or an amount of lean tissue mass, but further investigations are needed to establish method the most suitable for patients with CKD.",ovid

The Japan Society of Hepatology (JSH) sarcopenia criteria utilize bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) for assessing muscle mass rather than dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which can simultaneously diagnose these comorbidities. We investigated the correlations and interchangeability between the appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI) values determined using BIA and DXA and evaluated the diagnostic ability of DXA for sarcopenia and osteosarcopenia in patients with CLD., METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 173 patients with CLD. Sarcopenia was defined as low ASMIBIA according to the JSH and Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) criteria (ASMIBIA cutoff) or low ASMIDXA according to the AWGS criteria (ASMIDXA cutoff) and low handgrip strength. For women, a provisional cutoff value was set for ASMIDXA using the ASMIBIA cutoff (ASMIDXA-altered cutoff)., RESULTS: We found that ASMIBIA and ASMIDXA were significantly correlated (r = 0.921; P < 0.001). The Bland-Altman plots demonstrated substantial agreement between ASMIBIA and ASMIDXA, with a mean difference of 0.0116 kg/m2. The prevalence rates of sarcopenia and osteosarcopenia diagnosed using the ASMIBIA cutoff were 26.0% and 17.3%, respectively. The kappa coefficients for the prevalence of sarcopenia and osteosarcopenia were 0.759 and 0.775 between ASMIBIA cutoff and ASMIDXA cutoff and 0.780 and 0.806 between ASMIBIA cutoff and ASMIDXA-altered cutoff, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of DXA can facilitate the comprehensive assessment and management of musculoskeletal comorbidities in patients with CLD.

Forty-five female athletes (age = 21.2 +/- 2.0 years, height = 166.1 +/- 7.1 cm, weight = 62.6 +/- 9.9 kg) participated in this study. Variables measured through BIA and DXA were as follows: BF%, FFM, and LST of the arms (ARMS(LST)), the legs (LEGS(LST)), the trunk (TRUNK(LST)), and the total body (TOTAL(LST)). Compared with the DXA, the InBody 720 provided significantly lower values for BF% (-3.3%, p < 0.001) and significantly higher values for FFM (2.1 kg, p < 0.001) with limits of agreement (1.96 SD of the mean difference) of +/-5.6% for BF% and +/-3.7 kg for FFM.

The limits of agreement were +/-0.79 kg for ARMS(LST), +/-2.62 kg for LEGS(LST), +/-3.18 kg for TRUNK(LST), and +/-4.23 kg for TOTAL(LST). This study found discrepancies in BF% and FFM between the 2 devices. However, the InBody 720 and DXA appeared to provide excellent agreement for measuring total body and segmental LST. Therefore, the InBody 720 may be a rapid noninvasive method to assess LST in female athletes when DXA is not available.",ovid

The present study aimed to verify the adequacy of single-frequency BIA (SF-BIA) and multifrequency BIA (MF-BIA) compared to dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) for evaluating body composition in outpatients with heart failure., METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 55 patients with stable heart failure and left ventricle ejection fraction <=45% were evaluated for fat mass percentage, fat mass and fat-free mass by DEXA and compared with the results obtained by SF-BIA (single frequency of 50 kHz) and MF-BIA (frequencies of 20 and 100 kHz)., RESULTS: MF-BIA and DEXA gave similar mean values for fat mass percentage, fat mass and fat-free mass, whereas values from SF-BIA were significantly different from DEXA. Both SF-BIA and MF-BIA measures of body composition correlated strongly with DEXA (r > 0.8; P < 0.001), except for fat mass assessed by SF-BIA, which showed a moderate correlation (r = 0.760; P < 0.001). MF-BIA also showed a better agreement with DEXA by Bland-Altman analysis in all measurements. However, both types of equipment showed wide limits of agreement and a significant relationship between variance and bias (Pitmans's test P > 0.05), except MF-BIA for fat-free mass., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with DEXA, MF-BIA showed better accuracy than SF-BIA, although both types of equipment showed wide limits of agreement. The BIA technique should be used with caution, and regression equations might be useful for correcting the observed variations, mainly in extreme values of body composition.

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) introduces a new method for assessing body composition, specifically BMD measurement. Compared with existing ultrasound and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for BMD screening and diagnosis, BIA has the advantages of safety, convenience and speed. However, the accuracy of BIA for BMD measurement needs to be explored. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the novel BIA technique in conducting whole-body BMD assessments in the general population of Taiwan. Overall, 318 healthy adults in Taiwan (37.67 +/- 19.44 years of age; 145 male and 173 female patients) were included. Whole-body BMD was measured via foot-to-foot BIA-StarBIA-201 (StarBIA Meditek Co. LTD, Taichung, Taiwan) and the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) Lunar Prodigy technology (GE Medical Systems, Madison, WI, USA). Linear regression analysis, Pearson's correlation coefficient, the Bland-Altman plot, and paired t tests were used. The whole-body BMDs measured by BIA and DXA were 1.139 +/- 0.124 g/cm2 and 1.202 +/- 0.168 g/cm2, respectively. The regression equation was y = 1.057x + 0.063. The Pearson correlation coefficient, mean difference, and limits of agreement were r = 0.737, - 0.053 g/cm2, and - 0.290-0.165 g/cm2, respectively. The regression equation was y = 1.057x + 0.063. The Pearson correlation coefficient, mean difference, and limits of agreement were r = 0.737 (p < 0.001), - 0.053 g/cm2, and - 0.290-0.165 g/cm2, respectively. Standing BIA was correlated with the DXA gold standard for estimating whole-body BMD in adults; however, its interchangeability remains limited. The potential bias in the measurement results of this study represents a current challenge with BIA compared with that of DXA, and there is still room for improvement. The convenient BIA method for measuring whole-body BMD may be useful in the application of primary screening and future development of BMD assessment methods. BIA is widely used to measure body composition, but its application to the measurement of BMD represents a novel technological breakthrough. Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).",ovid

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) could provide a simpler, portative, and less expensive alternative. Because the body composition assessment by BIA is device-dependent, the aim of this study was to appraise the concordance between the specific bioelectrical impedance device InBody S10 and DXA for the body composition evaluation., METHODS: Body composition, included appendicular lean mass divided by height squared (ALM/ht(2)) was measured by DXA (Hologic QDR Discovery device) and by BIA (InBody S10 Biospace device). Agreement between tools was assessed by means of the Bland Altman method and reliability was determined using the IntraClass Coefficient (ICC). ICC was also computed to assess the reliability of the test-retest performed by the same operator or by two different ones., RESULTS: A total of 219 subjects were enrolled in this study (mean age: 43.7 +/- 19.1 years old, 51.6% of women). For the ALM/ht(2), reliability of the test-retest of the BIA was high with an ICC of 0.89 (95%CI: 0.86-0.92) when performed by the same operator and an ICC of 0.77 (95%CI: 0.72-0.82) when performed by two different operators. Agreement between ALM/ht(2) assessed by DXA and BIA was low (ICC = 0.37 (95%CI: 0.25-0.48)). Mean ALM/ht(2) was 9.19 +/- 1.39 kg/m(2) with BIA and 7.34 +/- 1.34 kg/m(2) with DXA, (p < 0001). A formula developed using a multiple regression analysis, and taking into account muscle mass assessed by BIA, as well as sex and body mass index, explains 89% of the ALM/ht(2) assessed by DXA., CONCLUSIONS: Although our results show that the measure of ALM/ht(2) by BIA is reliable, the agreement between DXA and BIA is low. Indeed, BIA seems to overestimate ALM/ht(2) compared to DXA and, consequently, it is important to use an adapted formula to obtain measurement of the appendicular lean mass by BIA close to that measured by DXA.",ovid

Patients were divided into 2 groups according to whether there was screw loosening: fissure is greater than or equal to 1 mm around the screws at follow-up CT scans. The volumetric BMD (vBMD) was measured by QCT in the central vertebral body, pedicle, and screw trajectory region, and DXA was applied for the lumbar spine and hip area BMD (aBMD). The overall pedicle screw loosening rate was 33.9% (63/186). Demographic data, health history, and the lumbar aBMD were not significantly different between the two groups. Multivariate analysis revealed showed that the hip aBMD, vBMD in the central vertebral body, pedicle, and screw trajectory regions were independent risk factors for screw loosening. Additionally, Receiver operating characteristic curve revealed the screw trajectory vBMD had the greatest area under the curve for predicting screw loosening. The screw trajectory vBMD using QCT had a stronger predictive value than the vBMD in other regions of the vertebrae and the hip aBMD, and had a more representative bone quality measurement in the bone-screw binding region.

The assessment of BMD using Hounsfield unit (HU) measurements from computed tomography (CT) scans has been correlated with DXA results in previous studies. We aimed to evaluate the correlation between shoulder CT HU and DXA scores., METHODS: Billing databases of 3 academic institutions were queried for patients who underwent both DXA and CT scan of the upper extremity within 1 year of each other. DXA T-scores for spine, hip, and femoral neck were recorded. BMD status was defined based on composite T-scores, using the lowest T-score in the spine, hip, or proximal femur. CT scans were measured for HU over 4 slices, recorded to create a bone column, then averaged. The patients' risks of major osteoporosis-related fracture and hip fracture were calculated using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool., RESULTS: In total, 300 patients were included. A positive correlation was found between composite T-scores and HU for glenoid and proximal humerus (0.36; 0.17). The proximal humerus HU was significantly associated with the BMD T-score for the hip (P = 0.01); the glenoid HU was significantly associated with BMD T-scores for the hip, spine, and femoral neck (P = 0.002; P = 0.001; P = 0.002).

Pre- and post-intervention body composition was assessed by DXA and B-mode US. Data were analysed using Pearson's correlation (r), Lin's correlation coefficient (CCC), paired t-tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and Bland-Altman analysis, as appropriate. Cross-sectionally, correlations were observed between total DXA FM and total subcutaneous tissue thickness (r = 0.88). Longitudinally, a correlation was observed between total DXA FM changes and total subcutaneous tissue changes (r = 0.49, CCC = 0.38). Correlations of similar magnitudes were observed for the upper body and trunk estimates, but DXA FM changes were unrelated to subcutaneous tissue changes for the lower body and arms. Cross-sectionally, US 2-compartment FM and DXA FM were correlated (r = 0.91, CCC = 0.83). Longitudinally, a weaker correlation was observed (r = 0.47, CCC = 0.33). In summary, longitudinal associations between US and DXA are weaker than cross-sectional relationships; additionally, correlations between US subcutaneous tissue and whole-body DXA FM appear to be driven by the trunk region rather than appendages. Reporting raw skinfold thicknesses rather than FM estimates alone may improve the utility of techniques based on subcutaneous tissue thickness, such as US and skinfolds.

BCA from CT shows a strong correlation between body fat ratio with DXA (r = 0.95, rhoC = 0.83) and BIA (r = 0.92, rhoC = 0.76) and between skeletal muscle ratio with BIA: r = 0.81, rhoC = 0.49. The deep learning-network achieves highly accurate results (mean Sorensen-Dice-score 0.93). Using BCA on routine Positron emission tomography/CT-scans to monitor patients' body composition in the diagnostic workflow can reduce additional exams whilst substantially amplifying measurement in slower progressing cancers such as GEP-NET.

JOUR,custom regional segmental lower limb lean soft tissue analysis in male and female division i athletes,DXA only,10.1519/JSC.0000000000005129,"['Joniak, Kelly E', 'Moore, Sam R', 'Ladan, Alex N', 'Cantu, Elena I', 'Britton, Morgan E', 'Smith-Ryan, Abbie E']",2025,"ABSTRACT: Joniak, KE, Moore, SR, Ladan, AN, Cantu, EI, Britton, ME, and Smith-Ryan, AE. Custom regional segmental lower limb lean soft tissue analysis in male and female Division I athletes. J Strength Cond Res 39(8): 868-874, 2025-Asymmetries in lean soft tissue (LST) may affect athlete availability and injury risk. Segmental custom regions of interest (C-ROI) analyses may reveal LST differences that could go undetected by whole limb analysis using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The purpose of the study was to describe a novel C-ROI LST segmental analysis method using DXA, and to characterize asymmetry across the sample and identify meaningful difference cut points for C-ROI segmental analyses in elite athletes. Full-body DXA testing was performed on 581 NCAA Division I athletes (46% female, mean +/- SD ; Age = 20.2 +/- 1.4 years, mass = 83.3 +/- 26.0 kg) from August 2015 to July 2023. Custom regions of interest analyses were completed for glute, thigh, and calf segments on each leg. Regional percent differences ([segment LST difference]/[total segment LST/2] x 100) were calculated and meaningful differences were established from mean and standard deviations between limbs of each segment. The C-ROI method demonstrated high inter-reliability at each segment (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.874-0.999). Average LST segmental limb differences for male athletes were (mean +/- SD ): glute = 1.4 +/- 4.4%, thigh = 0.3 +/- 2.9%, calf = 0.6 +/- 4.7%; and for female athletes: glute = 2.0 +/- 4.4%, thigh = 0.3 +/- 4.2%, calf = 0.8 +/- 4.6%. Values >2 standard deviations for male athletes (glute: 10.2%, thigh: 6.1%, calf: 9.9%) and female athletes (glute: 10.9%, thigh: 8.6%, calf: 10.0%) seemed to be clinically meaningful. Using meaningful regional difference cut points may provide staff (i.e., athletic trainers, dietitians, and strength coaches) insight into acceptable LST asymmetries to better support athlete performance and return to play.

JOUR,detection of low bone mineral density by dual energy x ray absorptiometry in unsuspected suboptimally treated coeliac disease,DXA only,10.1136/gut.37.2.220,"['Walters, J R', 'Banks, L M', 'Butcher, G P', 'Fowler, C R']",1995,"Patients with coeliac disease may present with calcium malabsorption but it is unclear whether this results in longterm impairment of bone mineralisation. Dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used to study bone mineral density in 34 asymptomatic coeliac disease patients, treated with a gluten free diet for at least two years, and also in 10 newly diagnosed or untreated patients. As expected, untreated patients had low bone mineral density in all regions. In the 29 treated female coeliac disease patients, overall mean values for age adjusted bone mineral density expressed as Z scores were normal although there were many patients with low values, particularly of the lumbar spine and total body. Scores in the postmenopausal patients were significantly worse than in the premenopausal patients and low mean Z scores were found in the five treated male patients. The subjects who had reduced bone mineral density could not be predicted clinically but, despite being asymptomatic, were more likely to have subtotal or partial villous atrophy on small intestinal biopsy (p < 0.0275). In conclusion, although many treated coeliac disease patients have normal bone mineral density, suboptimally treated and newly diagnosed or untreated patients have osteopenia. To reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures, it is recommended that bone mineral density be measured in all treated coeliac disease patients and those with osteopenia have a repeat intestinal biopsy to assess disease activity.",ovid

This study included adult cancer survivors from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008-2011 with complete data on Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements. A total of 310 participants were randomly divided into development and cross-validation groups (5:5 ratio).

Fat mass (FM, kg), fat mass percentage (FMP, %), fat-free mass (FFM, kg) and appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM, kg) were measured by DXA, BIA and ADP on the same day within 1 h., RESULTS: A total of 172 Chinese children and adolescents were included in this study. The agreements for FM, FFM and ASM estimated by the three methods were excellent or good at the population level (intraclass correlation coefficient > 0.850, P < 0.05). However, ADP or BIA estimated lower body fat content and higher FFM than DXA (P < 0.001 for all). Moreover, the precise estimates significantly varied across BMI categories.

There is no agreed universal definition for muscle wasting (sarcopenia), and we wished to determine whether using different criteria altered the prevalence in patients treated by peritoneal dialysis., METHODS: We measured lean body and appendicular lean mass indices in 325 outpatients by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, comparing muscle mass with that used to define muscle wasting (sarcopenia) by various clinical guideline publications., RESULTS: Lean body and appendicular lean mass indices did not differ by sex: female, 17.7 +/- 4.6 kg/m2; male, 17.4 +/- 4.3; female, 6.9 (5.6-8.5) kg/m2; male, 6.7 (5.3-8.3), respectively. Depending on the criteria, the prevalence of muscle wasting varied from 2.2%-31.3% for women and 25.1%-75.6% for men. Male patients were older (58.3 +/- 16 vs 53.4 +/- 15.7 years). Criteria based on cutoffs derived from young healthy patients gave the higher prevalence rates. The prevalence of muscle wasting was not associated with dialysis adequacy, estimated protein intake, duration of dialysis treatment, comorbidity, diabetes, or ethnicity. The prevalence of sarcopenic obesity was low (<5% females, 7% males)., CONCLUSION: We found that the prevalence varied markedly depending on the cutoff criteria used to define muscle wasting. Very few patients had sarcopenic obesity. The higher prevalence for males requires further study but was not associated with dialysis treatment. Our study highlights the need for agreed criteria to define pathologic muscle wasting from that which is age associated to allow for interventional screening programs.",ovid

Blood pressure and lipid profiles of these subjects were measured. Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and DEXA were used to evaluate the varying patterns of body fat distribution among the groups., RESULTS: Body fat distribution, as reflected by WHR and the centrality index, showed significant partial correlation coefficients with glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, and lipid profiles in all subjects. After adjusting for age and BMI, there were significant differences among the three glycemic groups for all the cardiovascular risk factors except for total cholesterol level. The diabetic group had a significantly higher WHR and centrality index, but lower femoral fat percentage than the NGT and IGT groups. The diabetic group also showed higher abdominal fat percentage than the NGT group. Moreover, the IGT group had a higher centrality index than the NGT group. However, no significant differences were found in the percentage of lean tissue mass among the three groups. Using multiple stepwise logistic regression models, the centrality index remained a significant factor for discriminating different glucose tolerance status independent of the percentage total body fat., CONCLUSIONS: Central obesity has shown significant correlation with cardiovascular risk factors among the three different glycemic groups. Centrality index measured by DEXA appears to be the better predictor of glucose intolerance, compared with WHR, abdominal fat, and general obesity (reflected by percentage total body fat or BMI) in a large cohort of the Chinese population.",ovid

Seventeen small slices of bone, each three millimeters wide, were removed so that, finally, 89 per cent of the bone was lost from the distal femoral metaphysis. Standardized lateral roentgenograms of the specimen were made with use of a reference step-wedge of hydroxyapatite, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry studies were performed with the x-ray beam tangential to the interface. The roentgenograms were digitized and the bone mineral was measured with use of computer analysis. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was performed with and without the femoral prosthesis in place, in order to determine the effect of the metallic prosthesis on the accuracy of the measurement. A bone loss of 25 per cent or more was identified visually by all five of the readers 100 per cent of the time; losses of 20 to 24 per cent, 15 to 19 per cent, 10 to 14 per cent, and 3 to 9 per cent were correctly identified 92, 75, 66, and 59 per cent of the time, respectively. The measurements of bone-mineral content that were obtained from the digitized roentgenograms were linearly correlated with the actual bone-mineral content (the ash content) (r = 0.97, p < 0.001) and were three times more accurate than the visual readings. The determinations of bone-mineral content with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry correlated highly with the ash content (r = 1.00, p < 0.001) and were seven times more accurate than the visual readings.

Three consecutive scans were performed for each participant, one with and two without extraneous spinal implant, without repositioning between scans. Lean, fat and bone estimates in the total body, trunk and limb were measured., RESULTS: Precision errors for all total and regional body compositions were within the recommended ranges. Bone masses in the trunk and total body were significantly increased with spinal implant, and the increases exceeded the least significant change. For total and regional lean and fat estimates, the measurements between subjects with and without metal implants were in substantial to almost perfect agreement and the differences were not significant and did not exceed the least significant change., CONCLUSIONS: Spinal metal artifacts significantly increased the total body and trunk bone mass but the differences in lean- and fat-related estimates at total and regional body levels and all estimates in the extremity remained within the clinical acceptable range. Thus, a spinal implant may not compromise screening of patients for fat and lean masses using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.

JOUR,does peak bone mass correlate with peak bone strength? cross-sectional normative dual energy x-ray absorptiometry data in 1052 men aged 18-28 years,DXA only,10.1186/s12891-019-2785-8,"['Lindgren, Erik', 'Rosengren, Bjorn E', 'Karlsson, Magnus K']",2019,"BACKGROUND: Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is used to estimate peak bone mass, define osteoporosis and predict fracture. However, as aBMD is calculated as bone mineral content (BMC) divided by the scanned area, aBMD displays an inverse relationship with bone size. In a skeleton that is increasing in size, this is a problem, as bone size is an independent factor that determines bone strength. It could therefore be questioned whether peak aBMD is the period with greatest bone strength, a period that in the hip then would occur in ages 16-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether there are changes in bone size in men after age 18 that may influence peak bone strength. Another aim was to provide updated normative DXA data., METHODS: We scanned left femoral neck by DXA in a cross-sectional study with a population-based selection of 1052 men aged 18-28, and then registered bone mineral content (BMC, gram), aBMD (gram/cm2) and bone area (cm2) in each one-year age group. We performed analyses of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate whether there were differences in these traits between the age groups. We then used Pearson's correlation analyses to test for trends with ageing after peak bone mass was reached., RESULTS: We found the highest absolute femoral neck aBMD at age 19, with statistically significant differences between the one-year age groups in BMC, aBMD, and bone area (all p < 0.05). From peak bone mass onwards (n = 962), there are negative correlations between age and BMC (r = - 0.07; p < 0.05) and age and aBMD (r = - 0.12; p < 0.001), and positive correlation between age and bone area (r = 0.06; p < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: As femoral neck bone size in young adult men becomes larger after peak bone mass, it could be questioned whether DXA estimated peak aBMD correlates with peak bone strength. We infer that aBMD must be interpreted with care in individuals with a growing skeleton, since skeletal strength may then increase, in spite of decreasing aBMD. This should be taken into account when performing DXA measurements in these ages.",ovid

The purpose of this study was to examine whether a newly developed and validated visceral fat measurement from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) provides added predictive value to the cross-sectional differences of cardiometabolic parameters beyond the traditional anthropometric and DXA adiposity parameters., METHOD: A heterogeneous cohort of 194 adults (81 males and 113 females) with a BMI of 19 to 54 kg/m(2) participated in this cross-sectional study. Body composition was measured with a DXA densitometer. Visceral fat was then computed with a proprietary algorithm. Insulin sensitivity index (SI, measured by intravenous glucose tolerance test), blood pressures, and lipid profiles, and peak oxygen uptake were also measured as cardiometabolic risk parameters., RESULTS: DXA-estimated visceral fat mass was associated with HDL cholesterol (regression coefficient [beta] = -5.15, P < .01, adjusted R(2) = .21), triglyceride (beta = 26.01, P < .01, adjusted R(2) = .14), and peak oxygen uptake (beta = -3.15, P < .01, adjusted R(2) = .57) after adjusting for age, gender, and ethnicity. A subanalysis stratifying gender-specific BMI tertiles showed visceral fat, together with ethnicity, was independently associated with SI in overweight men and moderately obese women (second tertile)., CONCLUSIONS: Without requiring additional CT or MRI-based measurements, visceral fat detected by DXA might offer certain advantages over the traditional DXA adiposity parameters as means of assessing cardiometabolic risks.

Progression was defined as 20% joint space narrowing or total hip replacement within a two years follow up. Software was developed to calculate geometrical aspects and bone mineral density (BMD) in different regions of interest of the proximal femur. Logistic regression was used to test if Kellgren and Lawrence (K-L) scores and DXA parameters can predict progression of OA. Models were compared using -2log likelihood tests, R2 Nagelkerke and areas under the Receiver Operator Characteristic curves, assessed using 10-fold cross validation., RESULTS: The model that included the DXA variables was significantly better in predicting hip OA progression than the model with K-L score of the affected side alone (P < 0.01). The addition of the differences in DXA parameters between the most affected and contralateral hip in the superior part of the femoral head, trochanteric and intertrochanteric area further improved the prediction of progression (P < 0.05). K-L score of the affected side was still the most significant single variable in the models., CONCLUSIONS: DXA parameters can significantly contribute to the prediction of progression in patients with hip osteoarthritis.

These regions were correlated with insulin sensitivity determined by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, insulin area under the curve after oral glucose tolerance test (AUC I); triglyceride; total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol; free fatty acids; and blood pressure. The analyses were performed in all subjects, as well as in lean and obese groups separately., RESULTS: Among the various indices of body fat, DXA-determined adiposity in the abdominal cut at L1-4 level was the most predictive of the metabolic variables, showing significant relationships with glucose infusion rate ([GIR], mg kg(-1) lean body mass x min(-1)), triglyceride, and cholesterol, independent of total-body mass (r = -0.267, P<0.05; r = 0.316, P<0.005; and r = 0.319, P<0.005, respectively). Upon subanalysis, these correlations remained significant in lean men, whereas in obese men, only BMI and the amount of leg fat (negative relationship) showed significant correlations with triglyceride and cholesterol (r = 0.438, P<0.05; r = 0.458, P<0.05; r = -0.439, P<0.05; and r = -0.414, P<0.05, respectively). The results of a multiple regression analysis revealed that 47% of the variance in GIR among all study subjects was predicted by AUC I, fat L1-4, diastolic blood pressure (dBP), HDL, and triglyceride as independent variables. In the lean group, fat L1-4 alone accounted for 33% of the variance of GIR, whereas in obese men, AUC I and dBP explained 68% of the variance in GIR., CONCLUSIONS: The DXA technique applied for the evaluation of fat distribution can provide useful information regarding various aspects of the insulin resistance syndrome in healthy subjects.

Nonetheless, there is increasing uncertainty regarding the relative superiority of DXA and little comparative data exist in young adults. This study aimed to identify which measure of adiposity determined by either DXA or anthropometry is optimal within a range of cardio-metabolic risk factors in young adults., METHODS AND RESULTS: 1138 adults aged 20 years were assessed by DXA and standard anthropometry from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. Cross-sectional linear regression analyses were performed. Waist to height ratio was superior to any DXA measure with HDL-C. BMI was the superior model in relation to blood pressure than any DXA measure. Midriff fat mass (DXA) and waist circumference were comparable in relation to glucose. For all the other cardio-metabolic variables, anthropometric and DXA measures were comparable. DXA midriff fat mass compared with BMI or waist hip ratio was the superior measure for triglycerides, insulin and HOMA-IR., CONCLUSION: Although midriff fat mass (measured by DXA) was the superior measure with insulin sensitivity and triglycerides, the anthropometric measures were better or equal with various DXA measures for majority of the cardio-metabolic risk factors. Our findings suggest, clinical anthropometry is generally as useful as DXA in the evaluation of the individual cardio-metabolic risk factors in young adults.",ovid

The accuracy and linearity of DXA in measuring low mineral content levels (ranging from 30 to 300 mg) was assessed using bone-simulating K2HPO4 phantoms. For in vivo precision, DXA was performed twice on left forearms of four new-born term babies, 21 preterm infants at corrected age 3 mo, and 20 at corrected age 6 mo. Bone mineral content (BMC in mg) and areal bone mineral density (BMD in mg/cm2) at distal forearm and forearm shaft were measured. A special software program allowing a free adjustment of the bone detection threshold was used in the analysis of the scan data. The threshold level affected the overall ability of analysis to detect bone tissue and altered significantly the BMC and BMD values too. Given absolute success in detecting low amounts of bone mineral (BMC > 100 mg), the lowest bone detection threshold evaluated (0.040 g/cm2) became the preferable choice. The relationships between the actual and measured data were highly linear (r was 0.94 for BMC and 0.97 for BMD) but showed underestimation (corresponding slopes were 0.66 and 0.64). In vivo precision expressed as 95% limits of agreement was approximately +/-45 mg for BMC and +/-16 mg/cm2 for BMD. We conclude that DXA provides adequate reliability for in vivo determinations of BMC and areal BMD in the distal and shaft sites of forearm in term and preterm infants and thus strongly supports the clinical utility of DXA in the diagnosis and monitoring of metabolic disease of prematurity. Movements during scanning are typical of pediatric measurements and may decrease the precision considerably. Therefore, every effort must be made to prevent movement artefacts. In addition, special attention must be paid to keeping the analysis procedures consistent.",ovid

Inclusion period into the study was exactly 1 year., MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Ten patients received oral prednisolone daily (group 1). Eleven patients were treated for several exacerbations with multiple systemic prednisolone courses, up to a period of 2 weeks per course, with a cumulative dose of > or = 1,000 mg (group 2). Likewise, 28 patients were treated with multiple systemic prednisolone courses, but with a cumulative dose < 1,000 mg (group 3).

Our aim was to evaluate the possible correlation between villous atrophy extension and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived parameters of bone status., METHODS: We have retrospectively analyzed data of 47 celiac patients (36 women, 52 +/- 14 years of age) who underwent video capsule endoscopy and DXA scans within 1 year of interval from 2006 to 2019. Quantitative, qualitative and geometric DXA parameters were collected only from the most recent DXA measurements., RESULTS: . Patients were divided into three categories; the first included those with no lesions at video capsule endoscopy (23 patients), the second those with typical lesions (mucosal atrophy, mosaicism and scalloping) in less than one-third of the small bowel (SB) (16 patients) and the third those with typical lesions in more than one-third of the SB (7 patients). In the third group, bone mineral density seemed to be lower in both the lumbar spine and the hip ( P = 0.026 and P = 0.011, respectively). The deterioration of bone structure in patients with severe and extended SB atrophy was statistically significant ( P = 0.032). Furthermore, bone density, structure and geometry did not correlate with the duration of the gluten-free diet. Notably, autoimmune comorbidities did not affect DXA results., CONCLUSION: Neither endoscopic nor histological atrophy itself can explain the deterioration of bone mineralization and structure, whereas atrophy extension appeared to be responsible for bone impairment.

Recently, vertebral bone quality evaluation using dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has been introduced. However, the DECT bone mineral density (BMD) in peripheral skeleton has not been correlated with Hounsfield units (HU) or central dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and the accuracy remains unclear. Materials and methods: Medical records of 117 patients who underwent TKA were reviewed. DXA was completed within three months before surgery. DECT was performed with third-generation dual source CT in dual-energy mode. Correlations between DXA, DECT BMD and HU for central and periarticular regions were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted and area under the curve (AUC), optimal threshold, and sensitivity and specificity of each region of interest (ROI) were calculated. Results: Central DXA BMD was correlated with DECT BMD and HU in ROIs both centrally and around the knee (all p < 0.01). The diagnostic accuracy of DECT BMD was higher than that of DECT HU and was also higher when the T-score for second lumbar vertebra (L2), rather than for the femur neck, was used as the reference standard (all AUC values: L2 > femur neck; DECT BMD > DECT HU, respectively). Using the DXA T-score at L2 as the reference standard, the optimal DECT BMD cut-off values for osteoporosis were 89.2 mg/cm3 in the distal femur and 78.3 mg/cm3 in the proximal tibia. Conclusion : Opportunistic volumetric BMD assessment using DECT is accurate and relatively simple, and does not require extra equipment. DECT BMD and HU are useful for osteoporosis screening before cementless TKA.",ovid

We also aimed to assess the dispensing patterns of anti-osteoporotic medications in this population., METHODS: ARAD participants aged >=18 years with a RA diagnosis from 2011 onwards and linked 2011-2023 Medicare Benefits Schedule and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme data were included (n = 306). Time to first DEXA and anti-osteoporotic medication dispensing was assessed using Kaplan-Meier failure functions and multivariable Cox regression. Covariates included age, sex, BMI, alcohol use, smoking and glucocorticoid use., RESULTS: The median time to first DEXA was 3 years (IQR 0, 10) following RA diagnosis. Predictors for DEXA included female sex (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1, 2.4), age >=50 (HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.8, 3.9) and glucocorticoid use (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3, 2.4). DEXA was less likely with BMI >=25 (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48, 0.96).

Screening practices were influenced by age, glucocorticoid use and BMI, with significant gaps, particularly after diagnosis. These gaps highlight the need for standardised screening protocols to ensure timely DEXA scans and treatment, ultimately improving osteoporosis management and reducing fracture burden.

Whereas it is regarded by many as a reference technique for such measurements, it is not without limitations. Inter and intra-manufacturer differences have been areas of concern. This review focuses on recent literature addressing these areas and the issue of validity., RECENT FINDINGS: Body composition measurements using newer generation dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry machines compared between different manufacturers and compared with earlier instruments continue to show differences that may be unacceptable, particularly for investigators upgrading their machines or involved in multicentre studies using different machines. In terms of validity, significant deviations at a group level are reported when compared with reference four-component models, and perhaps more importantly, wide limits of agreement are seen that are a concern for the interpretation of results at an individual level., SUMMARY: It is important that investigators recognize the limitations of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry technology in the interpretation of their results. There is a continuing need both for inter-machine comparisons and validation studies against accepted criterion methods, particularly as new software or technological changes are introduced. Such studies permit the development of translation equations for the cross-calibration of devices, and may be vital for cross-sectional studies.

With internal fixation, manual manipulation is not usually possible, and conventional radiographs may not give much useful information, particularly if only a small amount of callus is formed. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) provides an accurate method of quantifying the changes in bone mineral density (BMD) which occur during fracture healing. Preliminary work showed that the presence of a highly attenuating metal implant in the scan area did not affect the reliability of BMD data obtained from scans. On this basis, we have assessed the use of DXA in the clinical situation to monitor fractures treated by intramedullary nailing. Five fractures of the mid-shaft of the tibia stabilized by interlocked intramedullary nails have been monitored by DXA at monthly intervals through healing. DXA improves on radiography in giving a quantitative measure of fracture site mineralization.

It is unknown whether DXA is comparable to CT among cancer survivors, especially in cases where VAT assessment may be affected by treatment history and side effects and become more challenging to assess, such as a history of surgical gastrointestinal resection and/or ascites. The purpose of this study was to determine the level of agreement between DXA and CT when assessing VAT area and volume among cancer survivors. One hundred Gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancer survivors underwent abdominal and pelvis CT and whole-body DXA within 48 hours. Bland-Altman analysis revealed that in women and men, DXA VAT-area estimates were larger and smaller, respectively, and was consistently smaller in estimates for VAT-volume. Correlations from linear regression analysis revealed statistically significant positive correlations between measurement methods. Overall, while DXA VAT estimates are highly correlated with CT VAT estimates, DXA estimates show substantial bias which indicates the two methods are not interchangeable in this population.

However, there are various concerns regarding its validity, especially in the spine. No study has so far investigated whether in vivo DXA correlates with the actual lumbar bone architecture., METHODS: Lumbar DXA scans were compared with micro-CT analysis of vertebral biopsies in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures (fracture group) and those without (control group). Preoperatively, all patients underwent a DXA scan (L1-L4). Intraoperative biopsies from nonfractured vertebrae (preferably L3) were analyzed by micro-CT regarding bone quantity and quality. The groups were compared regarding differences in DXA and micro-CT results. In each group, a correlation analysis was performed between DXA and micro-CT., RESULTS: The study included 66 patients (33 per group). Preoperative DXA results were worse in the fracture group than the control group (areal bone mineral density [aBMD] 0.95 vs. 1.31, T-score -1.97 vs. 0.92, each P < 0.001).

Furthermore, we tested whether VAT estimations by these two methods are equivalent in assessing the metabolic risk in this population., DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Data from the Norwegian population of a multicenter study in adults with genetically proven PWS were used. Subjects with complete anthropometry, biochemical, and imagistic measurements at all study visits (baseline and after 12 and 24 months of GH treatment) (n = 14, six men) were included. VAT was quantified both using CT scans (GE Lightspeed 16 Pro) of the abdomen at L2-L3 level and a total body DXA scan (GE Healthcare Lunar Prodigy)., RESULTS: VAT DXA was strongly associated with VAT CT at baseline (r = 0.97) and after 12 (r = 0.90) and 24 months (r = 0.89) of GH treatment (all P < .001). We found moderate to strong positive correlations between VAT by both methods, and blood pressure, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, glucose metabolism, and other fat depots (arms, legs, android, trunk, total body) but no association with age, gender, blood lipids, and IGF-I. Adiponectin was negatively associated with the amount of VAT. At baseline, the highest correlation with homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was found for VAT DXA (r = 0.76, P = .001) and VAT CT (r = 0.75, P = .002), respectively., CONCLUSION: VAT can be accurately estimated by DXA, in patients with PWS, and might contribute to the assessment of the metabolic risk.",ovid

Different techniques used to evaluate body composition may vary in accuracy, particularly in conditions with altered fluid balance such as COPD. We hypothesized that direct measurement of fat-free mass index (FFMI) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) would provide superior assessment of body composition in COPD., METHODS: We measured body composition in 31 patients with COPD randomly selected from a teaching hospital clinic. To estimate total body water (TBW) and FFMI, skin-fold anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) with Schols and Lukaski equations as well as DEXA, total body potassium by whole-body gamma-counting (TBK) and in vivo neutron activation analysis were used. Combined body composition methods providing precise estimations of TBW were used for comparisons. Bland-Altman analyses, ANOVA and chi2-testing were used to examine data., RESULTS: Mean BMI was 27.6 +/- 5.34 kg/m2 (mean +/- SD). Estimations of TBW were similar using Schols BIA or by using combined body composition methods. FFMI did not vary significantly between grades of COPD severity but was significantly different when assessed using DEXA and other methods. Calculated FFM hydration was significantly different from the fixed hydration factor used to calculate FFMI from BIA TBW (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: The Schols BIA method incorporates a fixed hydration factor that may lead to an erroneous estimation of FFMI with ensuing clinical implications. DEXA can be used to obtain accurate and comprehensive assessments of body composition and should be the preferred investigation in COPD.",ovid

This post hoc analysis utilized data from a randomized, 2-period study of domagrozumab versus placebo in 120 ambulatory boys with DMD. DXA measures of lean body mass were obtained from the whole body (excluding head), arms, legs and appendicular skeleton at baseline and every 16 weeks. Treatment effects on DXA measures for domagrozumab versus placebo were assessed at Week 49. At Week 49, domagrozumab statistically significantly increased lean body mass versus placebo in the appendicular skeleton (p = 0.050) and arms (p < 0.001). The relationship between lean body mass at Week 49 and functional endpoints at Week 97 was evaluated. Changes in lean body mass at Week 49 in all regions except arms were significantly correlated with percent change from baseline in 4-stair climb (4SC) at Week 97. DXA-derived percent lean mass at Week 49 also correlated with 4SC and North Star Ambulatory Assessment at Week 97.

JOUR,dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry predicts bone formation in lower limb callotasis lengthening,DXA only,,"['Maffulli, N', 'Cheng, J C', 'Sher, A', 'Lam, T P']",1997,"The rate of regenerate bone mineral content (BMC) acceleration was studied using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) in callotasis lengthening of the lower limb. Eleven youngsters (age range 5-17 years) undergoing callotasis lengthening for congenital, post-traumatic or post-infective conditions were studied longitudinally. Patients were initially scanned once a week until completion of the lengthening phase, and at 2-week intervals thereafter until removal of the fixator. They were subsequently followed up at regular intervals on an outpatient basis for up to 2 years after removal of the fixator (average, 14 months). The BMC accretion slopes exhibited by the patients and the rate of new bone formation allowed the identification of three groups. In the fast formation group, the rate of new bone formation was 0.3-0.6% per day. In the moderate formation group the rate of new bone formation is 0.1-0.3% per day, while in the poor formation group the rate of new bone formation is < 0.1% per day. From the analysis of time graphs, a direct correlation emerged between early bone formation and subsequent bone mineral content accretion. Measurement of BMC during callotasis lengthening in the lower limb allows precise monitoring of the process. It may prove useful to prevent complications occurring after removal of the fixator at an unduly early stage, such as plastic deformation and fracture through the regenerate bone. It may be used to predict the bone formation rate in a given patient, and to implement measures to try to influence it.",ovid

Another five patients were selected who had been followed for osteoporosis by repeated DXA two to five times at intervals from 2 to 36 months. One healthy volunteer was followed for one day by means of DXA total body measurements. All protocols were analysed with respect to BMC, fat mass (FM) and lean tissue mass (LTM) of the imaged trunk and liver., RESULTS: BMC of the right trunk exceeded that of the left trunk in 78% of the investigated subjects. The right (liver) image dominated in all 81 investigations calculated from 60 subjects. There were intraindividual short- and longterm variations between repeated DXA examinations. The amounts of FM and LTM were distributed symmetrically between the right and left trunk., CONCLUSIONS: DXA registers BMC in the liver, which explains the general dominance of the right trunk.

The clinical usefulness of both methods was compared in the measurement of BMC in the forearm. DEXA had a long-term in vivo precision of 1% which was significantly better than that of DPA. Changes in the distribution of fatty tissue influenced the accuracy of the two spinal methods in different ways. Forearm BMC discriminated between the bone mass of early and late postmenopausal women to the same degree as DPA and DEXA. The variability in the response to estrogen treatment and placebo was much lower with DEXA and forearm BMC than with DPA.

However, there is a subset of individuals with BMI in this range who present with this metabolic abnormality (called metabolically unhealthy normal weight, MUHNW). Here we aimed to assess the adipose characteristics of people with MUHNW using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). This study included 3259 people with normal BMI who underwent health examinations from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2016. Body fat percentage (%BF), android-gynoid percent fat ratio (AG ratio), and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were measured simultaneously using DXA CoreScan software. Those with MUHNW comprised 12.67% of the sample. Among those with MUHNW, 71.6% of the women and 56.5% of the men showed high VAT amounts, but less than 40% of either showed high %BFs. Furthermore, considering the combined effects of fat amount and distribution, a normal BMI accompanied by high AG ratio and/or high VAT mass but low %BF presents a much higher risk for metabolic syndrome than when %BF is high, most predominantly in women. In conclusion, using DXA-measured abdominal fat, particularly VAT accumulation, is clinically more important than using %BF when assessing metabolic syndrome in those with normal BMI.",ovid

Four-compartment (4 C) models, which separately quantify fat mass, lean body mass, bone mineral content and total body water, offer improved accuracy but usually require multiple devices. This study aimed to validate dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived body volume (BV) equations-specifically those from Wilson and Smith-Ryan-against air displacement plethysmography (ADP), and to modify the Smith-Ryan equation for enhanced BV estimates in a 4 C model. Ninety healthy adults (50 females, 40 males; aged 18-66 years; BMI 18-34 kg/m2) were recruited at a single-centre facility. Participants underwent DXA scanning (GE Lunar DXA) for tissue composition, ADP (Bod Pod) for BV, and bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy for total body water, with all measurements performed by trained technicians. BV was estimated using the original Wilson and Smith-Ryan equations and a regression-modified Smith-Ryan equation, and these estimates were incorporated into the 4 C model to calculate percent body fat (%BF) and fat mass (FM). All DXA-based BV estimates correlated highly with ADP (r >= 0.99). Although the original equations showed small, statistically significant differences in %BF and FM compared to ADP (p < 0.05), the modified Smith-Ryan equation produced BV estimates equivalent to ADP (p = 0.998). These findings suggest that calibrated DXA-derived BV equations can reliably substitute for ADP in 4 C models, enhancing the accessibility and cost-effectiveness of body composition analysis. Future research should validate these findings in more diverse populations. Copyright © 2025 Scandinavian Society of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine.",ovid

Any long-term effects on estrogen-sensitive tissues such as bone may have important therapeutic implications., METHODS: We measured bone mineral density (BMD) in the lumbar spine and hip using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in premenopausal and postmenopausal healthy women who participated in our placebo-controlled tamoxifen chemoprevention of breast cancer trial., RESULTS: BMD data are now available from 179 women for this analysis. In premenopausal women, BMD decreased progressively in the lumbar spine (P < .001) and in the hip (P < .05) for women on tamoxifen, but not those on placebo. The mean annual loss in lumbar BMD per year over the 3-year study period in tamoxifen-treated compliant women who remained premenopausal throughout the study period was 1.44% (1.88% calculated on an intent-to-treat basis) compared with a small gain of 0.24% per annum for women on placebo (P < .001).

JOUR,effects of daily activities on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry measurements of body composition in active people,DXA only,10.1249/MSS.0b013e318228b60e,"['Nana, Alisa', 'Slater, Gary J', 'Hopkins, Will G', 'Burke, Louise M']",2012,"PURPOSE: Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is becoming a popular tool to measure body composition in athletes, owing to its ease of operation and comprehensive analysis of body composition. This study represents the first systematic investigation of the reliability of DXA measurements of body composition in trained individuals and includes measurements of daily variability as well as the specific effect of the intake of a meal., METHODS: Physically active young adults (15 females, 16 males) underwent five whole-body DXA scans during a 2-d period: in the morning after an overnight fast, ~5 min later after repositioning on the scanning bed, ~8 h later after usual daily activities, and the next morning before and ~30 min after consumption of a simple breakfast. Magnitudes of typical (standard) errors of measurement and changes in the mean of DXA measures were assessed by standardization., RESULTS: Repositioning produced trivial typical errors for whole-body composition, whereas regional body composition showed substantial errors. Daily activities and consumption of breakfast generally produced a substantial increase in the typical error and mean of DXA estimates of total and regional lean mass and associated body mass., CONCLUSIONS: Having a standardized scanning protocol and fasted subjects is the most practical way to minimize measurement errors. Future studies involving DXA in measuring body composition should report their scanning and analysis protocol with their associated typical errors of measurement so that the level of reliability can be assessed.",ovid

Subjects. Eighty men with HIV infection treated with antiretrovirals and 151 healthy male controls matched for age., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In part 1, body composition and fat distribution of the HIV-infected men were compared by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) with those of the controls to determine whether body fat distribution is altered in HIV-infected men. In part 2, we analyzed modifications of body composition and fat distribution in 45 of the 80 patients. These 45 had been exposed to antiretroviral drugs, including stavudine and a protease inhibitor, for at least 5 months before the first of two DEXA assessments. They received three different treatment strategies for several months. In group 1, stavudine was withdrawn; in group 2, protease inhibitor was discontinued, and in group 3, stavudine plus protease inhibitor were continued. Group 1 showed a significant fat gain in the lower extremities 31.7 +/- 5.9 months after stavudine discontinuation (p<0.0001). Group 2 did not show any significant modification of total body, lower limb, or trunk fat despite protease inhibitor discontinuation for 35.2 +/- 6.6 months. Findings were similar for group 3, who continued receiving stavudine-protease inhibitor therapy for 21.2 +/- 12.8 months., CONCLUSION: These data suggest that long-term withdrawal of stavudine from the antiretroviral therapy regimen may be associated with significant improvement in lipoatrophy in the lower extremities, whereas long-term protease inhibitor withdrawal did not modify fat distribution.",ovid

This study investigates the reliability of DXA in measuring body composition of active individuals, specifically to ascertain biological variability associated with two different types of exercise under free-living conditions in active individuals., METHODS: Well-trained individuals (27 strength-trained male subjects, 14 female cyclists, and 14 male cyclists) underwent three whole-body DXA scans over a 1-d period: in the morning after an overnight fast, approximately 5 min later after repositioning on the scanning bed, and shortly after a self-chosen exercise session (resistance training or cycling). Subjects were allowed to consume food and fluid ad libitum before and during exercise as per their usual practices. Magnitude of typical (standard) errors of measurement and changes in the mean of DXA measures were assessed by standardization., RESULTS: Exercise and its related practices of fluid and food intake are associated with changes in the mean estimates of total and regional body composition that range from trivial to small but substantial. An exercise session also increases the typical error of measurement of these characteristics by approximately 10%., CONCLUSION: The easiest and most practical way to minimize the biological ""noise"" associated with undertaking a DXA scan is to have subjects fasted and rested before measurement. Until sufficient data on the smallest important effect are available, both biological and technical ""noises"" should be minimized so that any small but potentially ""real"" changes can be confidently detected.",ovid

Eighteen women were measured with and without a pair of silicone breast prostheses placed on the upper part of the trunk simulating endogenous implants. Bone area, bone mineral content (BMC), areal bone mineral density (BMD), lean tissue mass (LTM) and fat tissue mass (FTM) of the total body and of the subregions of the body, i.e. the head, trunk, arms and legs, were measured by a Norland XR-36 DXA scanner. After application of the silicone prostheses, bone area, BMC and BMD of the total body significantly increased by an average of 3.7, 6.6 and 3.4% (P<0.0001), respectively. Total body LTM and FTM were not affected. In the trunk region, changes were more pronounced. Trunk BMC, for example, was overestimated by 17.9% (P<0. 0001). The prostheses also influenced measurements of truncal soft tissue composition, with a small but statistically significant overestimation of both LTM (1.1%) and FTM (2.1%) (P<0.05). No changes in bone mass and soft tissue composition were seen in the head, arms and legs. Activation of a high-density detection software utility provided by the manufacturer had no influence on any of the measurements.

The aim of the current study was to develop and validate, using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as reference method, a model that estimates abdominal fat mass percentage (AFM%) in white postmenopausal women based on simple and easy-to-apply anthropometric measurements. An additional aim was to validate an abdominal bioelectrical impedance analyzer (ViScan) for estimating waist circumference (WC) and AFM% in this group., METHODS: Ninety-one postmenopausal women (mean age, 61.5 y) with body mass index ranging from 20.9 to 42 kg/m2 were randomly divided into one training set (n = 60) and one testing set (n = 31) to develop and validate a model based on anthropometric measurements estimating abdominal fat mass. Furthermore, in all 91 participants, ViScan estimations of WC and AFM% were validated against tape measurement and DXA results., RESULTS: The model developed was AFM% = 4.496 + (0.318 x WC) + 0.342 x suprailiac skinfold (r = 0.834, P < 0.0001). The model had no significant bias (0.25%) and +/- 7.5% limits of agreement. ViScan significantly overestimated WC by 7.04 cm and estimated AFM% with no significant bias (-0.13%) and +/- 7.6% limits of agreement., CONCLUSIONS: Both the model and ViScan are equally valid against DXA in estimating AFM%. However, ViScan is not valid in estimating WC in white postmenopausal women.",ovid

Ulna length was measured as the distance between the proximal olecranon process and the distal styloid process of the ulna. Tibia length was measured as the distance from the proximal aspect of the medial condyle and the most distal aspect of the medial malleolus of the tibia using a segmometer. Length measurements were taken using an infant length board in children less than 24 months of age, whereas a portable stadiometer was used to measure height in older children. Equations were developed using ulnar and lower leg length and age. Intra- and inter-examiner variability (n=167) was calculated, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans (n=126) were used to determine accuracy of limb lengths., RESULTS: Ulnar and lower leg length explained over 95% of the variability in length/height in term infants and children, but less in preterm infants (R(2) =0.80-0.87). In preterm infants, the limits of agreement (LOA) for males were -2.44 to 2.44cm and -2.88 to 2.88cm for the ulna and lower leg respectively, whereas the LOA for females were -1.90 to 1.90cm and -1.87 to 1.87cm respectively. In older children, the LOA for males were -5.53 to 4.48cm and -5.59 to 4.62cm for the ulna and lower leg respectively, whereas the LOA for females were -5.57 to 5.01cm and -6.02 to 5.02cm respectively. Intra- and inter-examiner variability was low for all measurements in both sexes and age groups., INTERPRETATION: Length and height measurements using infant length board or stadiometer are reproducible. Because of the wide limits of agreement, estimation of length and height in children using ulnar and lower leg length is not an acceptable alternative to traditional methods.

The objective of this study is to establish a prediction model of SM for Chinese adults., METHODOLOGY: Appendicular lean soft tissue (ALST) was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and SM by magnetic resonance image (MRI) in 66 Chinese adults (52 men and 14 women). Images of MRI were segmented into compartments including intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) and IMAT-free SM. Regression was used to fit the prediction model SM = c + k x ALST. Age and gender were adjusted in the fitted model. The piece-wise linear function was performed to further explore the effect of age on SM. 'Leave-One-Out Cross Validation' was utilized to evaluate the prediction performance. The significance of observed differences between predicted and actual SM was tested by t test and the level of agreement was assessed by the method of Bland and Altman., RESULTS: Men had greater ALST and IMAT-free SM than women. ALST was the primary predictor and highly correlated with IMAT-free SM (R(2) = 0.94, SEE = 1.11 kg, P<0.001). Age was an additional predictor (SM prediction model with age adjusted R(2) = 0.95, SEE = 1.05 kg, P<0.001). There was a piece-wise linear relationship between age and IMAT-free SM: IMAT-free SM = 1.21xALST-0.98, (Age <45 years) and IMAT-free SM = 1.21xALST-0.98-0.04x (Age-45), (Age >=45 years). The prediction performance of this age-adjusted model was good due to 'Leave-One-Out Cross Validation'. No significant difference between measured and predicted IMAT-free SM was detected., CONCLUSION: Previous SM prediction model developed in multi-ethnic groups underestimated SM by 2.3% and 3.4% for Chinese men and women. A new prediction model by DXA has been established to predict SM in Chinese adults.",ovid

The race/ethnicity distribution for women was non-Hispanic white, 29%; Hispanic, 25%; African American (AA), 35%; Asian Indian, 3%; and Asian, 8%. The distribution for men was non-Hispanic white, 37%; Hispanic, 26%; AA, 22%; Asian Indian, 5%; and Asian, 10%. Abdominal fat (L1-L5) was estimated from whole-body scanning using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA Abd-Fat)., RESULTS: DXA Abd-Fat varied by race/ethnicity after accounting for WC and height in both women and men. The increase in DXA Abd-Fat per increase in WC was lower in the Asian and Asian-Indian women than that in the other women. The increase in DXA Abd-Fat per increase in WC was higher in the AA men and lower in the Asian-Indian men than that in the other men. These differential race/ethnicity effects were most notable when WC exceeded 90 cm in the women and 100 cm in the men, values which are consistent with current definitions of abdominal obesity in the United States., CONCLUSIONS: Prediction equations for abdominal fat using WC that do not account for race/ethnicity group provide biased estimates. These results may affect assessment of disease risk from abdominal obesity among racial/ethnic groups.",ovid

Differences are possible due to software versions. This investigation examined body composition, tissue distribution, BMC, and BMD measurements using a DXA (Lunar Corp., Madison, WI) with different software packages (versions 3.4 and 3.6R). Fifteen women, ages 20-40 yr, enrolled in a weight-loss study (body mass index = 28) and volunteered for body composition assessment by densitometry. BMC, BMD, and tissue distribution measurements were made using DXA. Results were analyzed once each with software versions 3.4 and 3.6R. BMC + total soft tissue, measured using DXA, was comparable to measured body weight (3.4 = 76.3 kg; 3.6R = 76.5 kg; weight = 76.5 kg). Lower BMC and BMD (5.5% and 1.8%, P < 0.01) were observed with 3.6R. Arm tissue mass was lower (1,530 g; P < 0.01) and fat declined (1,069 g; P < 0.01) with 3.6R.

This study measured cortical thickness and cortical thickness index (CTI) based on computed tomography (CT) and additionally, evaluated the T-score and trabecular bone score (TBS) based on the dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study is a cross-sectional study based on data from 600 patients aged from 20 to 93 years during the time from 2011 to 2021 were enrolled and selected the patients who did the examination of both pelvic CT and DXA scan. Age, sex, BMI, T-score, TBS, cortical thickness, CTI and the size of proximal femur were analyzed. Among these patients, 200 patients each corresponding to femoral neck fracture group(N = 200), trochanteric fracture group(N = 200), and non-fracture group(N = 200) were randomly selected and studied. The differences of three groups were compared statistically., RESULTS: Mean outer diameter of proximal femur was 24.34 mm, inner diameter of proximal femur was 15.28 mm, cortical thickness was 4.55 mm and CTI was 0.37 at the lesser trochanter (LT) level. The outer diameter was 24.00 mm, inner diameter of proximal femur was 13.04 mm, cortical thickness was 4.97mm and CTI was 0.44 at 3cm below LT. In the hip fracture group, T-score of hip, outer diameter of proximal femur and cortical thickness at LT were lower than non-fracture group. BMI, T-score of spine, T-score of hip, inner diameter at 3cm below LT, CTI of LT and TBS were lower in femoral neck fracture group compared to the trochanteric fracture group., CONCLUSION: Analysis of 600 patients of pelvic CT might be a representative of real size of proximal femur in South Korea. Outer diameter of proximal femur at LT and cortical thickness at LT level were significantly lower in hip fracture group. Narrower outer diameter of proximal femur and thinner cortical thickness at LT level from the CT might be a risk factor of hip fracture. Copyright: © 2025 Ma et al.

HU were measured by two radiologists using the largest spherical region of interest including the medullary bone of the femoral head from the junction point of the most caudal section of the femoral head with the femoral neck in 5-mm axial sections. The correlations of both sides' HU values with their ages and DXA femur T-score were evaluated., RESULTS: HU values obtained from both femoral heads showed significant variation between the osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic groups (both P = 0.000) and strongly correlated with each other and DXA femur T-scores (left r = 0.75, right r = 0.73, respectively). In ROC curve analysis, predictive power of left HU values in identifying patients with osteoporotic femur DXA T-score was 0.905, and for right HU values it was 0.924. Osteoporosis cutoff values were 198 HU and 204 HU for the left and right hips, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: HU obtained from CT performed in routine practice correlated with the DXA scores, thus providing an alternative method to determine regional bone quality without additional cost.

However, the average age of individuals in these studies was the mid-50s, which is younger than the typical age of individuals requiring treatment for primary osteoporosis. Therefore, we aimed to investigate factors associated with discordance in the percentage of young adult mean (YAM) between the lumbar spine and femoral neck in the elderly population., METHODS: We evaluated 4549 dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements obtained from 2161 patients (269 men and 1892 women) between January 2014 and December 2017 at our hospital. For individuals with more than one eligible set of measurements, the first record was used. We investigated each patient's age, sex, body mass index, current smoking status, alcohol consumption, use of steroids, presence of diabetes mellitus, and presence of rheumatoid arthritis., RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 76.4 +/- 8.9 years. Older age (p < 0.001), male sex (p < 0.001), and diabetes mellitus (p = 0.007) were significantly associated with spine-femur discordance in the percentage of YAM., CONCLUSION: The frequency and magnitude of spine-femur discordance in the percentage of YAM from DXA scans increased with age. Notably, more than 77.4% of patients in their 90s had spine-femur discordance > 10% of YAM. Furthermore, the frequency of spine-femur discordance was higher in men and in patients with diabetes mellitus, suggesting that the percentage of YAM at the lumbar spine may not be reliable for diagnosis of osteoporosis in patients with these factors.

Estimated monthly changes of body composition measures in the ALS cohort were compared to those of the PD cohort and were correlated with disease progression measured by the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R)., RESULTS: The ALS cohort (N = 20) had lower baseline total and appendicular lean mass indices compared to the PD cohort (N = 20) and general population. Loss in total and appendicular lean masses were found to be significantly associated with follow-up time. Low baseline percentage body fat (r = 0.72, p = 0.04), loss of percentage body fat (r = 0.81, p = 0.01), and total fat mass index (r = 0.73, p = 0.04) during follow up correlated significantly with monthly decline of ALSFRS-R scores in ALS cohort who had 2 or more follow-ups (N = 8)., CONCLUSION: Measurement of body composition with DEXA might serve as a biomarker for rapid disease progression in ALS.",ovid
JOUR,fat-free mass prediction equations for bioelectric impedance analysis compared to dual energy x-ray absorptiometry in obese adolescents: a validation study,DXA only,10.1186/s12887-015-0476-7,"['Hofsteenge, Geesje H', 'Chinapaw, Mai J M', 'Weijs, Peter J M']",2015,"BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, patient friendly methods to assess body composition in obese adolescents are needed. Therefore, the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) related fat-free mass (FFM) prediction equations (FFM-BIA) were evaluated in obese adolescents (age 11-18 years) compared to FFM measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (FFM-DXA) and a new population specific FFM-BIA equation is developed., METHODS: After an overnight fast, the subjects attended the outpatient clinic. After measuring height and weight, a full body scan by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and a BIA measurement was performed. Thirteen predictive FFM-BIA equations based on weight, height, age, resistance, reactance and/or impedance were systematically selected and compared to FFM-DXA. Accuracy of FFM-BIA equations was evaluated by the percentage adolescents predicted within 5% of FFM-DXA measured, the mean percentage difference between predicted and measured values (bias) and the Root Mean Squared prediction Error (RMSE). Multiple linear regression was conducted to develop a new BIA equation., RESULTS: Validation was based on 103 adolescents (60% girls), age 14.5 (sd1.7) years, weight 94.1 (sd15.6) kg and FFM-DXA of 56.1 (sd9.8) kg. The percentage accurate estimations varied between equations from 0 to 68%; bias ranged from -29.3 to +36.3% and RMSE ranged from 2.8 to 12.4 kg. An alternative prediction equation was developed: FFM = 0.527 * H(cm)(2)/Imp + 0.306 * weight - 1.862 (R(2) = 0.92, SEE = 2.85 kg). Percentage accurate prediction was 76%., CONCLUSIONS: Compared to DXA, the Gray equation underestimated the FFM with 0.4 kg (55.7 +/- 8.3), had an RMSE of 3.2 kg, 63% accurate prediction and the smallest bias of (-0.1%). When split by sex, the Gray equation had the narrowest range in accurate predictions, bias, and RMSE. For the assessment of FFM with BIA, the Gray-FFM equation appears to be the most accurate, but 63% is still not at an acceptable accuracy level for obese adolescents. The new equation appears to be appropriate but await further validation. DXA measurement remains the method of choice for FFM in obese adolescents., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands Tria",ovid

We aimed to establish whether a risk stratification strategy using a fracture risk calculation tool (FRAX) to determine which patients should receive a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan is effective in reducing scan rates without compromising sensitivity for detecting osteoporosis., METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 252 patients with liver cirrhosis attending hepatoma surveillance clinics. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to assess sensitivity and specificity at 10-year fracture risk thresholds of 5, 10 and 15%., RESULTS: DXA scans were performed among 252 patients. Mean age was 61.6+/-10.2 years, of which 53.2% were male. Cirrhosis aetiology was largely a result of alcohol excess (n=33.3%), chronic hepatitis C virus infection (n=20.2%) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (n=15.9%). The majority of patients were in good prognostic groups (87.4% Child-Pugh A, 11.3% Child-Pugh B, 1.3% Child-Pugh C). Osteoporosis was present in 19.0% of those who underwent DXA scanning. The optimum 10-year fracture risk threshold was found to be 10% using the FRAX tool. This retained a high sensitivity of 95.8%, specificity 64.7%, and negative predictive value 98.5%. Introduction of a 10% FRAX threshold would result in a reduction of the DXA scanning rate to 46.8% of the current rate., CONCLUSION: A risk stratification strategy for DXA scanning using a fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) and a 10-year fracture risk threshold of 10% leads to a significant reduction in scan rates without compromising osteoporosis detection rates.",ovid
JOUR,fracture stiffness in callotasis determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scanning,DXA only,,"['Tselentakis, G', 'Owen, P J', 'Richardson, J B', 'Kuiper, J H', 'Haddaway, M J', 'Dwyer, J S', 'Evans, G A']",2001,"Assessing healing after distraction limb lengthening is essential to manage patients undergoing callotasis for leg lengthening or bone transport. Direct measurement of fracture stiffness can assess healing but the equipment may not be available. In addition, it requires removal of the fixator, which may be complicated for ring fixators. The present study investigates whether an equivalent measure of healing can be based on the mineral density pattern from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. Nine consecutive patients undergoing callotasis were studied. Bending stiffness of the distraction segment was measured and DXA scans were performed regularly starting 6 weeks after completing distraction. In all, 23 simultaneous readings of bending stiffness and DXA scans were obtained. All density patterns showed a distinct minimum value of bone mineral density. We found a high and significant correlation between fracture bending stiffness and the square of the total mineral content at the location of minimum bone density (r2 = 0.77, P < 0.001). We conclude that DXA scans can be used reliably and effectively to determine fracture bending stiffness, valuable for determining both time of frame removal and delay in union.",ovid

We developed accurate anthropometric models to estimate dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry BF% (DXA-BF%) that can be generalized to ethnically diverse young adults in both cross-sectional and longitudinal field settings., METHODS: This longitudinal study enrolled 705 women and 428 men (aged 17-35 yr) for 30 wk of exercise training (3 d.wk(-1) for 30 min.d(-1) of 65%-85% predicted VO2max). The distribution of ethnicity was as follows: 37% non-Hispanic white, 29% Hispanic, and 34% African-American. DXA-BF%, skinfold thicknesses, and body mass index (BMI) were collected at baseline and after 15 and 30 wk., RESULTS: Skinfolds, BMI, and race/ethnicity were significant predictors of DXA-BF% in linear mixed model regression analysis. For comparable anthropometric measures (e.g., BMI), DXA-BF% was lower in African-American women and men but higher in Hispanic women compared with non-Hispanic white. Addition of BMI to the skinfold model improved the SEE for women (3.6% vs 4.0%), whereas BMI did not improve prediction accuracy of men (SEE = 3.1%)., CONCLUSIONS: These equations provide accurate predictions of DXA-BF% for diverse young women and men in both cross-sectional and longitudinal settings. To our knowledge, these are the first published body composition equations with generalizability to multiple time points, and the SEE estimates are among the lowest published in the literature.",ovid

Formulae, designed for clinical use, have been developed to predict glomerular filtration rate (GFR) utilizing serum creatinine (Scr). Additional parameters are included in these formulae to account for variations in Scr due to differences in total body lean mass in kg (LM). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to derive a simple formula to predict GFR based on Scr and direct quantification of LM., METHODS: Ten subjects with a wide range of renal function had GFRs determined by [125I]iothalamate clearance and LM determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry as well as fasting measurements of Scr, serum and 24 h urine urea nitrogen, and albumin., RESULTS: The following formula was derived using LM (kg) and Scr (mg/dl): predicted GFR=(2.4xLM)-(0.75xLMxScr). The correlation coefficient for this formula was 0.97, when compared with [125I]iothalamate clearances, and similar to the MDRD formulae (R=0.87-0.95)., CONCLUSION: Although further validation is necessary, these findings suggest that total body non-invasive measurement of LM along with Scr can be used to accurately predict GFR.",ovid

Height restrictions for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry: what are our options for body composition and bone health precision? J Strength Cond Res 38(7): e359-e365, 2024-Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is commonly used for testing athlete's body composition, but many athletes are too tall. The first aim was to assess the viability of combining upper- and lower-body regions of interest (ROI), creating a combined scan for tall athletes who do not fit on the table and second, to provide practical solutions to DXA users who routinely scan tall athletes. Sixty subjects (34.8 +/- 11.9 years; 171 +/- 9 cm) completed 2 total-body DXA scans for baseline precision testing, using GE Lunar Prodigy (LP) or Hologic Horizon A (HA) models. Next, an upper body ROI from the skull to the distal femoral condyles was combined with a flipped scan (feet-to-head) ROI encompassing the proximal tibial plateau to the distal foot. Soft and bone tissue coefficient of variance (CV%) were calculated between the baseline scans and for the newly combined ROI scan. The combined ROI scan added 0.25-0.63% and 0.01-4.35% error rates for the LP and HA, respectively. An exploratory assessment of a GE Lunar iDXA demonstrated results similar to the HA with 4%+ error. The combined ROI scan is a user-friendly and precise method for older LP systems adding less than 1% error; however, newer DXA systems cannot use the stitched scan technique. Coaches and practitioners who use newer DXAs must prioritize consistently using the same boney landmarks (head, jaw, or feet) and ROI heights to provide precise longitudinal assessments of tall athletes' bone and body composition, until larger DXA tables become available.

Significant fibrosis was defined as a METAVIR stage greater than 1. Steatosis was graded as: 0, none; 1, steatosis involving less than 5% of hepatocytes; 2, 5-29%; 3, 30-60%; 4 greater than 60%, and was defined as more than 0. Poisson regression with robust variance was used to estimate prevalence ratios of the outcome measures., RESULTS: The population was 62% male and 84% black with a median body mass index of 25.2 kg/m (interquartile range 22.5, 29.3 kg/m). No differences in regional body fat or fat distribution were observed in 42 patients with significant fibrosis compared to others with less fibrosis. However, the 77 individuals (45%) with steatosis had greater central fat than those without steatosis [prevalence ratio 1.04 per kg trunk fat; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04, 1.11], after adjusting for hepatic fibrosis (prevalence ratio 1.77; 95% CI 1.29, 2.42), uncontrolled HIV replication (viral load >400 copies/ml) (prevalence ratio 1.57; 95% CI 1.12, 2.22), age, sex, race and diabetes mellitus., CONCLUSIONS: In HIV/HCV co-infected individuals, measures of regional body fat or fat distribution were not associated with hepatic fibrosis. In contrast, increased central adiposity by DXA, as well as concomitant fibrosis and uncontrolled HIV, were associated with hepatic steatosis. The extent to which weight loss and effective antiretroviral therapy can reduce the risk of steatosis deserves further investigation.",ovid

For 24 h, athletes consumed a diet providing excessive energy availability (EA) (75 kcalkg fat-free mass (FFM) -1 ) without exercise (GEA rest ), high-EA (45 kcalkg FFM -1 ) without (HEA rest ) or with exercise (HEA ex ), or low-EA (15 kcalkg FFM -1 ) without (LEA rest ) or with exercise (LEA ex ). Exercise involved two bouts of cycling (morning bout: 149 +/- 34 min at 55% of maximal aerobic capacity (VO 2max ); afternoon bout: 60 min at 65% of VO 2max ) that resulted in a cumulative exercise energy expenditure of 30 kcalkg FFM -1 . The following day, RMR and DXA measurements occurred after a 10-h fast and 12-h postexercise., RESULTS: There were neither sex differences in relative RMR ( P = 0.158) nor effects of any of the five conditions on RMR ( P = 0.358).

For each condition, body composition was assessed in the morning after an overnight fast, in the afternoon after feeding, and the following morning after a second overnight fast., RESULTS: Acute food ingestion, regardless of macronutrient content, altered DXA and BIA body composition estimates, and both sexes responded similarly. DXA total and regional lean soft tissue estimates increased up to 1.7% and 3% on average in response to feeding, with individual increases of over 4.5% and 9%. DXA total and trunk fat mass estimates decreased by up to 3% on average. All DXA-derived measures of body composition returned to baseline values after the second overnight fast. Impedance measured by BIA decreased by 4.4% in response to feeding, leading to a 2% increase in total body water and fat-free mass, with individual increases up to 4.5%. BIA fat mass estimates decreased 1.4% to 2.4%, with individual decreases of up to 10%. Unlike DXA, most BIA-derived estimates did not return to baseline values after a second overnight fast., CONCLUSIONS: Acute food and fluid intake can artificially influence body composition estimates, regardless of macronutrient content.

Total body (TB), lumbar spine (LS), and femoral neck (FN) dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans were performed on 83 patients with TS (aged 4-24 yr). A prepubertal subgroup (n = 17) receiving GH was followed for 24 months. Age z-scores for height, TB BMC, LTM, the BMC/LTM ratio, and LS volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) decreased significantly (P < 0.001) with age in prepubertal subjects (n = 51) but were constant in the combined pubertal and postmenarchal group (n = 32).

The z-scores for height and LTM increased in both groups. Our results show a height-independent prepubertal decrease in bone mass accrual, which ceased with puberty. Optimizing bone mass in TS may require earlier induction of puberty than currently recommended. However, reduced FN volumetric bone mineral density and a dissociation of bone and muscle measures were age independent, suggesting an additional intrinsic bone defect.",ovid

A software upgrade designed for infant whole body (InfWB) (V5.56) led to a reassessment of DXA by: 1) reanalysis of the original scans using InfWB software and 2) comparison of InfWB-estimates of bone mineral content (BMC) and lean and fat mass with chemical analysis. Other assessments included 1) methods of regional analysis and 2) artifacts and the Infant Table Pad in the scan field. The mean coefficients of variation for InfWB whole body measures in small piglets (n = 10, weight 1575 +/- 73 g) and large piglets (n = 10, weight 5894 +/- 208 g) were less than 2.6% except for fat mass which was higher (8.0% versus 6.3% and 6.6% versus 3.5%, respectively) compared with PedWB. In large piglets InfWB produced good estimates of BMC, lean and fat masses. In small piglets, fat mass by InfWB was correlated with chemical analysis, but not by PedWB. There was improvement in the estimation of BMC with InfWB, from 27 +/- 2.2 g to 32 +/- 2.3 g (carcass ash = 38 +/- 3.3 g). Femur BMC analysis by InfWB was precise and was accurate when compared with chemical analysis. Artifacts in the DXA scan field (diapers and blankets) resulted in an increase of the DXA-estimated fat and lean masses.

Associations between birthweight and fat mass, and between weight gain and fat mass, were evaluated using multiple regression analysis., RESULTS: There was a significant positive association between weight gain from birth to age 1.5 years and fat mass in adolescents (boys: standardized regression coefficient (beta) = 0.253, p < 0.01; girls: beta = 0.246, p < 0.01), but not between birthweight standardized for gestational age and fat mass., CONCLUSION: Children with a greater change in weight from birth to age 1.5 years tended to have increased fat mass in adolescence. Weight gain in early life has a greater impact on fat mass in adolescents than birthweight. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).",ovid
JOUR,influence of adipose tissue mass on dxa-derived lean soft tissue mass in middle-aged and older women,DXA only,10.1007/s11357-014-9741-1,"['Abe, Takashi', 'Patterson, Kaitlyn M', 'Stover, Caitlin D', 'Young, Kaelin C']",2015,"The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of fat-free adipose tissue mass (FFAT) on association between dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived lean soft tissue mass and skeletal muscle mass (TMM). Forty-one middle-aged and older women were recruited for this study. Percent body fat, total and appendicular fat mass (tFM and aFM, respectively), and total and appendicular lean soft tissue mass (tLM and aLM, respectively) were measured using a DXA. FFAT was calculated based on the methods of a previous study. TMM was estimated from the ultrasound-derived prediction equation. The subjects were separated into three groups based on DXA-determined percent fat: low (n = 12, <25 %), middle (n = 15, >=25 and <35 %), and high (n = 14, >=35 %). DXA-derived aLM was greater in high than in middle or low, although ultrasound-estimated TMM was similar among the three groups. There was a strong correlation between aLM and TMM (r = 0.905, p < 0.001). The difference between aLM and TMM was correlated (p < 0.001) with aFM (r = 0.599) and tFM (r = 0.587). After adjusting for FFAT, aLM minus appendicular FFAT was similar among the three groups. aLM minus appendicular FFAT was strongly associated with TMM (r = 0.912, p < 0.001). Our results suggest that DXA-derived aLM accurately predicts TMM when subjects have moderate or lower adipose tissue mass. However, FFAT may falsely inflate the DXA-derived aLM measurement in individuals with a relatively high amount of adipose tissue mass (>35 % of body fat). Therefore, in this population, it is advisable to use DXA-derived aLM minus FFAT when evaluating age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass.",ovid

Measurements of total and regional bone area, bone mineral content (BMC), areal bone mineral density (BMD), lean tissue mass (LTM) and fat tissue mass (FTM) were made using a Norland XR-26 DXA scanner with dynamically changing samarium filtration. Twenty-one subjects who were free of metal implants were measured without and with a Biomet femoral prosthesis (titanium) placed on the proximal part of the femoral region. Twenty-one women with an endogenous prosthesis in the proximal femur were measured once. Analyses of tissue composition were performed without and with HDD using software provided by the manufacturer. Measurements were considerably affected by exogenous metal with overestimation of LTM and underestimation of FTM and bone area. BMC and BMD were over- or underestimated depending on the anatomical region. Enabling the HDD mode, values of bone area and tissue mass came closer to the expected values (-metal/-HDD) but were in general still significantly different from these. For the total body, the following significant changes were found after application of metal (+metal/-HDD vs. +metal/+HDD, mean values): bone area -19.8% vs. -6.9%, BMC +1.1% vs. -2.1%, BMD +26.5% vs. +4.7%, LTM +12.4% vs. +3.7%, FTM -15.8% vs. -7.0%. A similar pattern of change in tissue composition and bone area was found for the subregions of the body. Changes in tissue composition after HDD were similar in subjects with exogenous and endogenous metal, indicating that the experimental model was appropriate. In conclusion, measurements of tissue composition were substantially influenced by orthopaedic metal. HDD partly corrected for the artefacts induced by the metal.",ovid

The addition of heel thickness aims at a better separation of fatty tissue from bone than the standard method of DXA, which may mistake fatty tissue for bone and vice versa. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether DXL of the calcaneus can be used to assess the 10-year risk of fractures. Secondary aims were to compare the predictive ability of DXL with the two most established methods, Dual energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) of the hip and spine and the WHO fracture risk assessment tool, FRAX. In 1999 a cohort of 388 elderly Swedish women (mean age 73.2 years) was examined with all three methods. Prospective fracture data was collected in 2010 from health care registers. One SD decrease in BMD of the heel resulted in an age-adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR) of 1.47 for a hip fracture (95% CI 1.09-1.98). Harrell's C is the Cox regression counterpart of the Area Under Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) as a measure of predictive accuracy. Harrell's C for BMD of the calcaneus was 0.65 for prediction of hip fractures. These results were not significantly different from those for BMD of the femoral neck or for FRAX. The HR for a hip fracture, for one SD decrease in BMD at the femoral neck, was 1.72 (95% CI 1.21-2.44. Harrell's C was 0.67 for BMD at the femoral neck and 0.59 for FRAX. We conclude that DXL of the calcaneus could be a useful tool for fracture risk assessments.",ovid

We evaluated three techniques for LBM estimation, including dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), creatinine kinetics (CrKin), and bioimpedance (BI) in 10 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Two different formulae were applied for BI LBM estimation, Segal (S) and Deurenberg (D). Mean values (+/- SEM) of LBM estimated were 48.2 +/- 3.6, 46.12 +/- 2.87, 43.32 +/- 3.87, and 41.27 +/- 4.26 by DEXA, BI-S, BI-D, and CrKin, respectively. LBM by CrKin was significantly lower than that by DEXA and BI-S values. There was no statistically significant difference between DEXA and BI-S values. Statistically significant correlations were found between LBM values by all methods. Particularly strong correlations were found between DEXA versus BI-S (r = 0.976) and BI-S versus BI-D (r = 0.98). Because clinical assessment of hydration status is inaccurate, and both BI and DEXA measure excess extracellular water in LBM, falling muscle mass may be missed by these techniques. The CrKin technique for estimating LBM at normal body fluid volumes (dry weight) may be a better index of nutritional status in patients on CAPD because this may truly reflect the dry LBM and changes in muscle mass. Both DEXA and BI include excess body water in LBM and may mask malnutrition in the presence of subclinical or clinical overhydration, which is common in patients on peritoneal dialysis.",ovid

We investigated bone abnormalities in long-term survivors after busulfan cyclophosphamide-conditioning regimen, followed by human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling SCT. Bone density was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) and phalangeal osteosonogrammetry (OSG) in 41 patients 1-10 yr after allo-SCT. Using colony-forming units-fibroblast (CFU-F) assay, we analyzed the repopulating capacity of clonogenic fibroblast progenitors belonging to the osteogenic stromal lineage. LS and FN bone mineral density (BMD) and phalangeal densitometric values were significantly reduced, compared with 188 healthy controls (P < 0.001). Decrease in T-score less than 1 SD was documented in 29% and 52% of patients at the LS and FN, respectively. OSG detected densitometric values with a T-score less than 1 SD in 68% of transplanted patients. The patients examined within the first 3 yr after transplant showed low BMD, which remained stable at FN and improved at LS. Phalangeal densitometry was low up to 10 yr after transplant. CFU-F was found permanently depressed and unable to give rise to a confluent stroma. Low serum osteocalcin levels were present throughout the whole follow-up period. A significant correlation was found between densitometric values detected by both techniques and CFU-F growth in vitro. Osteonecrosis was associated with lower FN BMD, and phalangeal densitometry correlated inversely with duration of amenorrhea and chronic graft vs. host disease requiring long-lasting steroid therapy. In conclusion, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and phalangeal OSG may provide complementary information on bone density after allo-SCT. Prolonged severe impairment of femoral BMD and phalangeal densitometry suggest that bone loss may persist for many years after transplant. Inability to regenerate a normal number of osteoblastic precursors in the stromal stem cell compartment may in part account for severe long-lasting posttransplant decrease in bone mass.",ovid

Cobb angles of the lumbar spine were measured by lumbar anteroposterior DXA and the prevalence of lumbar scoliosis (curvature >=10degree) was calculated. Correlations between lumbar scoliosis and potential risk factors (age, sex, duration of RA, T score of lumbar spine and hip, medications for RA [daily predonisolone dose, use of biological agents] and osteoporosis, disease activity score-C-reactive protein, progression stage and functional classification of RA, and severity of hand deformity were analyzed., RESULTS: The prevalence of lumbar scoliosis in patients with RA was 32.0%. Mean Cobb angle was 7.1 +/- 5.5 among all subjects, compared with 13.6 +/- 4.4 (range, 10-32) among subjects with scoliosis. Subjects with scoliosis were significantly older (67.8 yr) than those without (61.6 yr, P < 0.0001). The daily prednisolone dose was significantly higher in subjects with scoliosis (4.14 mg) than in those without (3.46 mg, P = 0.0389). The T score of the hip was significantly smaller in subjects with scoliosis (-1.79) than in those without (-1.26, P = 0.0005). A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed age as the sole risk factor for lumbar scoliotic changes in patients with RA (odds ratio, 1.068; 95% confidence interval, 1.031-1.107; P = 0.0003)., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of lumbar scoliosis in patients with RA was 32.0%, about 3- or 4-times higher than its prevalence as obtained from previous reports of DXA cohorts irrespective of RA. Increased age represented an independent risk factor for lumbar scoliosis in patients with RA., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.",ovid

However, there are no published population-based studies on the association between maternal preconception weight and offspring body fat measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The present population-based retrospective cohort study aimed to examine the association between maternal weight at conception and offspring body fat measured by DXA., METHODS: The source population consisted of 5th-grade students (1244 students aged 11 years) registered at 8 municipal elementary schools in Kitakata, Fukuroi, Hamamatsu, and Himeji in Japan. The present analyses included 964 participants who provided complete information. Maternal body mass index (BMI) at conception was calculated using records in the Mother and Child Health Handbook (MCHH). Offspring body fat at age 11 years was measured with the same QDR-4500A DXA instrument in a mobile test room that was brought to each school. With regard to the prediction of excess fat in offspring, the area under the curve (AUC) calculated with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to quantify the diagnostic accuracy of maternal BMI at conception., RESULTS: Adjusted odds ratios for excess body fat in offspring of the overweight mother group (odds ratios, 4.93 to 15.32) were significantly higher than those in the non-overweight mother group. For the prediction of excess offspring fat, AUCs and 95% confidence intervals for maternal BMI at conception were greater than 0.5., CONCLUSION: Maternal overweight status at conception might be a risk factor for excess body fat in offspring. Maternal BMI values calculated using MCHH data have the potential to distinguish between the presence and absence of excess fat in the next generation. Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).",ovid

Energy expenditure (EE) was measured under standard conditions in a respiration chamber, the total and regional body composition by DXA, and total body composition by BIA. When body composition was measured by BIA, 88.5% of the variation in 24-h EE was explained by lean body mass (LBM); this figure was increased by DXA, where total lean tissue mass (LTM) and total fat tissue mass (FTM) could account for 91.5% of the variation. Also, the prediction of resting energy expenditure (REE) was improved by DXA, from 88.1% to 89.8% (LBM vs. LTM, FTM). Measurements of regional body composition showed that trunk LTM was significantly superior as a predictor, especially of REE and sleeping EE (EE sleep), compared to the peripheral LTM; thus, the predictions of REE were 83% vs. 87% (peripheral vs. trunk), respectively; and the predictions of EE sleep were 83% vs. 89% (peripheral vs. trunk), respectively. Therefore, body composition measurements by DXA improved the prediction of EE. Trunk LTM was a superior predictor, especially of REE and EE sleep, compared to peripheral LTM.

The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate two clinical methods to assess FFM in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) using deuterium dilution (DEU) as reference and bromide dilution to assess the ratio between intracellular (ICW) and extracellular water (ECW) as potential confounder., METHODS: Body composition was measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and DEU in 22 stable patients from our heart failure outpatient clinic and 24 healthy age matched controls., RESULTS: FFM values measured by DXA and DEU in patients (r = 0.92, SEE: 3.1 kg) and controls (r = 0.99, SEE: 1.3 kg) were strongly related. In both patients and controls, the inter method difference increased with higher values of FFM (DXA overestimating DEU). The ICW/ECW ratio was within the normal range and comparable between the groups. In patients, a highly significant correlation coefficient was found (r = 0.93, SEE 2.1 p = 0.01) between total body water (DEU) and height squared/resistance (Ht2/R).

Microstructural bone parameters evaluated at the appendicular skeleton by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) display differences between healthy patients and fracture patients. With the simple geometry of the cortex at the distal tibial diaphysis, a cortical index of the tibia combining material and mechanical properties correlated highly with bone strength ex vivo. The trabecular bone score derived from the scan of the lumbar spine by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) correlated ex vivo with the micro architectural parameters. It is unknown if these microstructural correlations could be made in healthy premenopausal women., METHODS: Randomly selected women between 20-40 years of age were examined by DXA and HR-pQCT at the standard regions of interest and at customized sub regions to focus on cortical and trabecular parameters of strength separately. For cortical strength, at the distal tibia the volumetric cortical index was calculated directly from HR-pQCT and the areal cortical index was derived from the DXA scan using a Canny threshold-based tool. For trabecular strength, the trabecular bone score was calculated based on the DXA scan of the lumbar spine and was compared with the corresponding parameters derived from the HR-pQCT measurements at radius and tibia., RESULTS: Seventy-two healthy women were included (average age 33.8 years, average BMI 23.2 kg/m(2)). The areal cortical index correlated highly with the volumetric cortical index at the distal tibia (R = 0.798). The trabecular bone score correlated moderately with the microstructural parameters of the trabecular bone., CONCLUSION: This study in randomly selected premenopausal women demonstrated that microstructural parameters of the bone evaluated by HR-pQCT correlated with the DXA derived parameters of skeletal regions containing predominantly cortical or cancellous bone.

We performed statistical appearance modeling (SAM) and principal component analysis (PCA) to efficiently encode the variance of body shape, leanness, and thickness across sample of 400 older Americans from the Health ABC study. The sample included 200 cases and 200 controls based on 6-year mortality status, matched on sex, race and BMI. The final model contained 52 points outlining the torso, upper arms, thighs, and bony landmarks. Correlation analyses were performed on the PCA parameters to identify body shape features that vary across groups and with metabolic risk. Stepwise logistic regression was performed to identify sex and race, and predict mortality risk as a function of body shape parameters. These parameters are novel body composition features that uniquely identify body phenotypes of different groups and predict mortality risk. Three parameters from a SAM of body leanness and thickness accurately identified sex (training AUC = 0.99) and six accurately identified race (training AUC = 0.91) in the sample dataset. Three parameters from a SAM of only body thickness predicted mortality (training AUC = 0.66, validation AUC = 0.62). Further study is warranted to identify specific shape/composition features that predict other health outcomes.",ovid

Using a Hologic QDR 4500 (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) DXA-scanner, MXA scans covering the vertebrae from T4 to L4 were acquired for each subject. Anterior (Ha), middle (Hm), and posterior (Hp) heights of the thoracic (T4-T12) and lumbar (L1-L4) vertebral bodies were measured. Moreover, wedge, mid-wedge, crush I, and crush II ratios were calculated., RESULTS: No correlation between vertebral dimensions and crush indices on the one hand and age or weight on the other were found. Body height, however, correlated significantly with the cumulated vertebral heights. Reference data for vertebral dimensions, wedge, mid-wedge, crush I, and crush II are tabulated., CONCLUSION: The anterior, middle, and posterior heights of the vertebral bodies of T4 to L4 can be measured reproducible with MXA.

The reference against which other body composition approaches are usually validated or calibrated is the family of methods referred to as multicomponent ""body density"" models. These models quantify three to six components by combining measurements of body mass, body volume, total body water, and osseous mineral mass. Body mass is measured with calibrated scales, volume with underwater weighing or air-displacement plethysmography, total body water with isotope dilution, and osseous mineral mass by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Body density is then calculated for use in model as body mass/volume. Studies over the past decade introduced a new approach to quantifying body volume that relies on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measurements, an advance that simplifies multicomponent density model development by eliminating the need for underwater weighing or air-displacement plethysmography systems when these technologies are unavailable and makes these methods more accessible to research and clinical programs. This review critically examines these new dual-energy X-ray approaches for quantifying body volume and density, explores their shortcomings, suggests alternative derivation approaches, and introduces ideas for potential future research studies.

The purpose of this study was to develop, and validate against dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), a BIA formula to predict fat-free mass (FFM) specific for patients with chronic severe respiratory insufficiency. Seventy-five ambulatory patients (15 females and 60 males) with severe chronic respiratory insufficiency (obstructive and restrictive) aged 63.6+/-19.2 yrs (mean+/-SD), in a stable pulmonary and cardiac condition for > or = 2 months, were measured simultaneously with BIA and DXA. Patients younger than 45 yrs of age and with a body mass index > or = 32 kg x m(-2) were excluded. The best-fitting multiple regression equation to predict FFM = -6.06 +/- (height x 0.283) +/- (weight x 0.207) - (resistance x 0.024) +/- (sex (males=1, females=0) x 4.036), gave a correlation coefficient of r=0.952, slope+/-SEM 0.902+/-0.034, standard error of the estimate 1.670, and p<0.0001. The mean difference for FFM was 0.2+/-2.3 kg (mean+/-SD) and percentage fat mass was -0.7+/-3.8%. These results suggest that the bioelectrical impedance analysis formula specific to patients with severe respiratory insufficiency give a better correlation and smaller mean differences than 12 different bioelectrical impedance analysis formulae described in the medical literature.

However, its size and bulkiness limit its use in mass screening. Portable and easily accessible instruments are more suitable for this purpose. We conducted a study to assess the repeatability, sensitivity, accuracy, and validation of a new ultrasound densitometer for the calcaneus (OsteoSys BeeTLe) compared to standard DXA. BMD (g/cm2) was measured at the femoral and lumbar spine levels using DXA (Discovery Acclaim (Hologic, Waltham, MA, USA) or Lunar Prodigy (GE Healthcare, Madison, WI, USA) devices). Bone Quality Index (BQI, a dimensionless measure of bone quality derived from measures of SOS [Speed Of Sound] and BUA [broadband ultrasound attenuation]) was measured with OsteoSys BeeTLe. The Bland-Altman test and simple linear regression were used to evaluate the association between values measured with the two instruments. Additionally, the ability of the T-score calculated with BeeTLe to identify patients with previous osteoporotic fractures was tested using ROC curves. A total of 201 patients (94.5% females) with a mean age of 62.1 +/- 10.2 were included in the study. The BeeTLe instrument showed a coefficient of variation (CV, in 75 repeated measurements) of 1.21%, which was not statistically different from the CV of DXA (1.20%). We found a significant association between BQI and BMD at the femoral neck (r2 = 0.500, p < 0.0001), total femur (r2 = 0.545, p < 0.0001), and lumbar spine (r2 = 0.455, p < 0.0001). T-scores bias were 0.215 (SD 0.876), 0.021 (SD 0.889) and 0.523 (SD 0.092), for femoral neck, total hip and lumbar spine respectively. AUC for discriminating fracture and non-fractured patients were not significantly different with OsteoSys BeeTLe and standard DXA. In this preliminary study, BeeTLe, a new point-of-care ultrasound densitometer, demonstrated good repeatability and performance similar to DXA.

Quantitative ultrasonography (QUS) measures cortical bone strength., OBJECTIVE: To compare QUS with DXA in patients with Turner's syndrome., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven Turner's syndrome patients, aged 21.1 +/- 6.3 years (mean +/- SD), were evaluated by DXA, measuring two-dimensional bone mineral density (BMD), and QUS, measuring speed of sound (SOS) of the radius and tibia. The results were compared to sex- and age-matched (Ctr A, n = 53) and height-matched (Ctr B, n = 34) control groups., RESULTS: Fracture incidence per 1000 women years was 4.76 in Ctr A, 5 in Ctr B and 7.69 in Turner's patients. In Turner's syndrome patients, QUS results were significantly lower than in controls, whereas DXA Z-scores were not different from reference values. Correlation between tibia and radius SOS and height and age in controls (P < 0.0001) was not evident in Turner's syndrome. Oestrogen or growth hormone therapy had no effect on either QUS or DXA parameters., CONCLUSIONS: Bone fragility in Turner's syndrome is reflected by low SOS but not by DXA BMD. Low QUS, which assesses the cortical bone only, supports a defect in cortical bone in Turner's syndrome. Lack of SOS correlation with age, height and hormonal therapy in Turner's syndrome suggests a primary bone defect, rather than enhanced resorption of endocrine origin.",ovid

According to the T-score of the 1st lumbar vertebra on DXA, patients were divided into the osteoporosis group (T [Formula: see text]- 2.5, n = 112) and non-osteoporosis group (T [Formula: see text] - 2.5, n = 127). The HAP values of the 1st lumbar vertebra were measured from the coronal-view HAP(Fat)-based material decomposition(MD) images, and CT values were measured on the 75 keV monochromatic image. The cutoff values of using HAP and CT value for diagnosing osteoporosis were obtained by drawing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Both HAP and CT value of the 1st lumbar vertebra had moderate-high correlation with bone-mineral-density measurement on DXA (HAP, r = 0.614; CT value, r = 0.625; all p < 0.01).

Standard dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measuring bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck and lumbar spine (central sites) has suboptimal sensitivity in predicting fracture risk in the general population. An association between sarcopenia and osteoporosis in PD has not been studied. We compared BMD and osteoporosis prevalence in PD patients vs controls; determined the osteoporosis detection rates using central alone vs central plus distal radius DXA; and analyzed factors (in particular, sarcopenia) associated with osteoporosis. One hundred and fifty-six subjects (102 patients with PD, 54 spousal/sibling controls) underwent femoral neck-lumbar spine-distal radius DXA. Seventy-three patients and 46 controls were assessed for sarcopenia using whole-body DXA and handgrip strength. Patients underwent clinical and serum biochemical evaluations. PD patients had significantly lower body mass index compared to controls. After adjustment for possible confounders, distal radius BMD and T-scores were significantly lower in PD patients compared to controls, but not at the femoral neck/lumbar spine. With distal radius DXA, an additional 11.0% of patients were diagnosed with osteoporosis (32.0% to 43.0%), vs 3.7% in controls (33.3% to 37.0%) additionally diagnosed; this increase was largely driven by the markedly higher detection rate in female PD patients. Female gender (adjusted odds ratio [ORadjusted]?=?11.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6–48.6) and sarcopenia (ORadjusted?=?8.4, 95% CI: 1.1–64.9) were independent predictors for osteoporosis in PD.

Ideally, all patients at risk for osteoporosis would be screened using the best test available, which is central BMD by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). We proposed to stratify the risk for osteoporosis by the use of a simple questionnaire and point-of-care heel ultrasound BMD measurements., DESIGN: Cross-sectional screening study., SETTING: Pulmonary clinic in a single Veterans Affairs Medical Center., PATIENTS: Approximately 200 male and female patients who had not had previous BMD testing were eligible for the study, and 107 gave consent., INTERVENTIONS: One hundred seven men (white, 71 men; black, 35 men; and Asian, 1 man) underwent heel BMD testing and filled out a questionnaire. Ninety-eight men underwent a central DXA., RESULTS: Of 98 subjects, 24.5% had a spine, total hip, or femoral neck (FN) T-score of <or= -2.5, which is the generally accepted definition of osteoporosis diagnosed using DXA, and 44.9% had a T-score of <or= -2.0. The best-fit models for predicting FN or total hip BMD included body weight, heel BMD, corticosteroid use for >or= 7 days, and race, which accounted for 52 to 57% of the variance. When a heel ultrasound T-score of -1.0 was tested to predict a central DXA T-score of -2.0, the sensitivity was 61% and the specificity 64%. Adding the questionnaire score and body mass index (BMI) to the heel T-score improved sensitivity but not specificity. Moreover, BMI and age predicted central BMD with similar sensitivity and specificity. Importantly, of 24 patients with a central DXA T-score of <or= -2.5, only 14 were identified by a heel T-score of <or= -1.0., CONCLUSIONS: Although the findings from a heel ultrasound plus the answers to a questionnaire were reasonably good indicators for predicting the presence of low BMD, little predictability was gained over the use of BMI and age.

To address this issue, recent research explores alternative indicators from peripheral skeletal sites to enable earlier and more accessible screening. In this paper, we propose a method to predict osteoporosis using hand and wrist X-ray images, which are widely available and cost-effective, though their association with DXA-based diagnoses is not yet fully established. Our approach employs an image segmentation model utilizing a mixture of probabilistic U-Net decoders, which captures predictive uncertainty when segmenting the ulna, radius, and metacarpal bones. The segmentation task is formulated as an optimal transport (OT) problem, effectively addressing the variability inherent in medical images. Additionally, we adopt a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that pretrains the model on augmented, unlabeled data to learn robust, invariant feature representations. These features are subsequently fine-tuned in a supervised classification task to distinguish osteoporotic from normal cases. We evaluate our method on X-rays from 192 individuals with verified DXA diagnoses. By combining uncertainty-aware segmentation and self-supervised feature learning, our framework offers a promising vision-based strategy for early osteoporosis detection using peripheral X-ray imaging.

Bone biopsy and high-resolution imaging indicate that cortical thickness (CT) is reduced and cortical porosity is increased in ESKD. The aim of this study was to assess cortical parameters using DXA in patients with ESKD. It was hypothesized that these parameters would show deterioration and be associated with fracture., METHODS: Using advanced hip analysis, normal age-related ranges were determined from 752 female and 861 male femur scans and were compared with scans of 226 patients with ESKD at the time of transplantation., RESULTS: Compared with controls, female patients had lower mean+/-SD CT (mms) at the femoral neck (FN) (2.59 +/- 1.42 versus 5.23 +/- 1.85), calcar (3.46 +/- 1.07 versus 5.09 +/- 1.30) and shaft (4.42 +/- 1.21 versus 7.44 +/- 2.07; P < 0.001 for each), and buckling ratios were higher (8.21 +/- 4.6 versus 3.63 +/- 1.42; P < 0.001), indicating greater FN instability. All findings were similar for men. Prevalent fracture was documented in 28.8% of patients; 12.4% vertebral only, 8.4% non-vertebral only and 8% vertebral plus non-vertebral.

Bone mineral density assessment by DEXA has been described as insensitive for diagnosing OP in the lumbar spine. Improving the detection of OP can bring more patients to treatment and reduce the risks associated with low bone mineral density., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients with DEXA scans and noncontrast CTs of the lumbar spine over a 15-year period. Patients were diagnosed as non-OP if they had a normal DEXA T -score (>= -1) or osteopenic DEXA T -score (between -1.1 and -2.4). Patients in this cohort were considered osteoporotic by CT if L1-HU <=110. Demographics and lumbar HUs were compared between these stratified groups., RESULTS: A total of 74 patients were included for analysis. All patients were demographically, similar, and the average patient age was 70 years. The prevalence of OP determined by CT L1-HU <=110 was 46% (normal DEXA: 9%, osteopenic DEXA: 63%). A significant number of males in our study were considered osteoporotic by L1-HU <=110 (74%, P = 0.03). All individual axial and sagittal lumbar HU measurements including L1-L5 average lumbar HUs were statistically significant among non-OP and OP groups except for the lower lumbar levels ( P > 0.05 for L4 axial HUs, and L4-L5 sagittal HUs)., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of OP in patients with normal or osteopenic T -scores is high. Among those with osteopenia by DEXA, more than 50% may lack appropriate medical treatment. The DEXA scan may be particularly insensitive to male bone quality making the CT HU the diagnostic method of choice for detecting OP., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

Among 189 adults [73 males, 116 females; age = 41 to 74 years; mean body mass index (BMI) = 27.3 kg/m(2)], assessments of %BF at the baseline and six months from the baseline were conducted by performing BIA and DXA. Bland-Altman analyses and multiple regression analyses were used to assess the relationships between %BFBIA and %BFDXA. Compared with DXA, BIA underestimated %BF [in males: 4.6, -2.4 to 11.7 (mean biases, 95% limit of agreement) at the baseline, 1.4, -7.4 to 10.2 at the endpoint, and 3.2, -4.8 to 11.3 in changes; in females: 5.1, -2.4 to 12.7; 2.2, -6.1 to 10.4; and 3.0, -4.8 to 10.7, respectively]. For males and females, %BFDXA proved to be a significant predictor of the difference between DXA and BIA at the baseline, the endpoint, and in changes when BMI and age were considered (in males: p<0.01 and R (2) = 23.1%, 24.1%, 20.7%, respectively; for females: p<0.001 and R (2) = 40.4%, 48.8%, 25.4%, respectively).

Five ROIs were defined around MCP and/or PIP joints II-V, II-IV and mid-metacarpal to mid-phalangeal. They were evaluated for precision using the root mean square coefficient of variation (RMS-CV) and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for inter-reader reliability. To test validity, established RA patients (n = 25) and early arthritis patients (n = 25) were compared with healthy controls (n = 37) matched on sex, age and menopausal status using paired t-tests, ROC curves and scatterplots., RESULTS: The RMS-CV was 0.45-1.07%. The ICC was 0.99. Mean BMDs of the five ROIs ranged from 0.321 to 0.372 g/cm(2) in established RA, from 0.321 to 0.382 g/cm(2) in early arthritis and from 0.342 to 0.401 g/cm(2) in healthy controls.

Bone mineral density measurement by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the gold standard, but indices on plain hip radiographs also seemed to be reliable screening tools in female or Asian ethnicities in previous studies. Given the lack of knowledge about male patients and Caucasian ethnicities, this study was conducted to evaluate plane hip radiographic indices as a screening tool for osteopenia and osteoporosis in Caucasian female and also male patients before undergoing THA. A retrospective analysis of 216 elderly patients with pre-existing DXA before hip arthroplasty was performed and four indices were calculated on plain hip radiographs: Canal-Flare-Index (CFI), Canal-Calcar-Ratio (CCR), Canal-Bone-Ratio (CBR) 7 and 10 cm below the lesser trochanter. They were correlated with femoral neck DXA T-scores by Pearson's correlation and intraclass correlation coefficient, and a ROC analysis was performed. A total of 216 patients (49.5% male) were included. CBR-7 and -10 were highly correlated (p < 0.001) with femoral neck T-score in males (Pearson's correlation CBR-7 r = - 0.60, CBR-10 r = - 0.55) and females (r = - 0.74, r = - 0.77). CBR-7 and -10 also showed good diagnostic accuracy for osteoporosis in the ROC analysis in males (CBR-7: AUC = 0.75, threshold = 0.51; CBR-10: 0.63; 0.50) and females (CBR-7: AUC = 0.87, threshold = 0.55; CBR-10: 0.90; 0.54). Indices such as the Canal Bone Ratio (CBR) 7 or 10 cm below the lesser trochanter on plain hip radiographs are a good screening tool for osteopenia and osteoporosis on plain hip radiographs and can be used to initiate further diagnostics like the gold standard DXA.

However, it remains unclear whether trunk muscle mass (TMM) measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can predict the trunk muscle CSA. The aim of this study is to determine if DXA-derived TMM is associated and predicts with CSA of paraspinal muscles and gluteus maximus measured using MRI in healthy volunteers., METHODS: A total of 48 healthy volunteers underwent whole-body DXA and MRI of the spinopelvic region. The CSA of the psoas major, back muscles, and gluteus maximus were measured on axial MRI. Correlations and linear regressions between the TMM measured using DXA and the CSA of each musculature were investigated., RESULTS: There was a weak correlation between TMM and CSA of the psoas major in men (r = 0.39, P = 0.0678), and the linear regression was y = 301.74x - 401.24 (R2 = 0.2976, P = 0.0070). A moderate correlation was found in women (r = 0.58, P = 0.0021), and the linear regression was y = 230.21x - 695.29 (R2 = 0.4445, P = 0.0003). Moderate correlations were observed between TMM and CSA of the back muscles in both men (r = 0.63, P = 0.0012) and women (r = 0.63, P = 0.0007), the linear regression was y = 468.52x + 3688.5 (R2 = 0.5505, P < 0.0001) in men and y = 477.39x + 2364.1 (R2 = 0.564, P < 0.0001) in women. There was a strong correlation between TMM and CSA of the gluteus maximus in men (r = 0.72, P < 0.0001), and the linear regression was y = 252.69x - 880.5 (R2 = 0.6906, P < 0.0001).

It might be a safer and cheaper alternative for evaluating the size of the back muscles and gluteus maximus. Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).",ovid

Intra- and interobserver errors were also determined for image analysis. For clearly defined regions of interest, the following precision values were obtained for BMD with low intra- and interobserver error: 1.7% (lumbar spine), 1.3% (femoral neck), 1.2% (distal femur), 1.0% (patella), 0.7% (proximal tibia), 1.3% (calcaneus) and 1.9% (distal radius).

The bones were then scanned using dental CBCT to measure the volumetric cortical bone mineral density (vCtBMD) and the cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI) for calculating the bone strength index (BSI). A three-point bending test was conducted to measure the fracture load of each femur and tibia. Bivariate linear Pearson analysis was used to calculate the correlation coefficients (r values) among the CBCT measurements, DXA measurements, and three-point bending parameters., RESULTS: The correlation coefficients for the associations of the fracture load with areal BMD (measured using DXA), vCtBMD (measured using CBCT), CSMI (measured using CBCT), and BSI were 0.585 (p = 0.028) and 0.532 (p = 0.050) (for the femur and tibia, respectively), 0.638 (p = 0.014) and 0.762 (p = 0.002), 0.778 (p = 0.001) and 0.792 (p<0.001), and 0.822 (p<0.001) and 0.842 (p<0.001), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: CBCT was found to be superior to DXA for predicting cortical bone fracture loads in rat femurs and tibias. The BSI, which is a combined index of densitometric and geometric parameters, was especially useful. Further clinical studies are needed to validate the predictive value of BSI obtained from CBCT and should include testing on human cadaver specimens.",ovid

Osteoporosis is now quantified using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), although it was originally assessed by radiogrammetry. A new updated system of radiogrammetry has been developed: digitized X-ray radiogrammetry (DXR). We used this DXR system to identify whether changes seen in hand X-rays of RA patients can predict those who subsequently develop erosions., METHODS: We enrolled 24 patients with early RA and they attended for hand radiographs at baseline, 12, 24 and 48 months. The hand radiographs were analysed using a Pronosco X-Posure system which measures bone mineral density, and other parameters using DXR. DXA of the hand was also performed to measure bone mineral density. Sharp and Larsen radiographic scores were calculated and other disease activity markers were measured., RESULTS: DXR bone mineral density fell significantly throughout the study. The group of RA subjects were divided according to the change in erosive status. Change in DXR bone mineral density after 1 yr was very specific (100%) and highly sensitive (63%) in predicting those who either became erosive or whose erosions significantly worsened. In contrast, of the other disease activity markers, only baseline ESR (sensitivity 67%, specificity 80%) significantly predicted the erosive status of subjects at 4 yr., CONCLUSION: Computerized radiogrammetry from digitized images can predict at 1 yr those patients with RA who will become erosive at 4 yr. A larger prospective study is required to confirm these findings; however, these results show some promise as a method of targeting those patients who require more aggressive, expensive therapy.",ovid

Predictive equations were derived from two multiple linear regression models, a comprehensive model (height(2)/resistance (RI), six anthropometric measurements) and a simple model (RI, height, weight). Their uncertainty was quantified by means of 10-fold cross-validation approach. Prediction error of FFM was 3.0% for both equations (root mean square error: 360 and 356 g, respectively). The derived equations produced BIA-based prediction of FFM and FM near DXA scan results. We suggest that the predictive equations can be applied in similar population samples aged 2-4 years. The derived equations may prove useful for studies linking body composition to early risk factors and early onset of obesity.",ovid

The relation between bone mineral density and pullout strength of the screw has been investigated previously, but no studies are available on the fatigue loosening in anterior spinal fixation., METHODS: Bone mineral density was measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and the screw loosening was produce by a cyclic loading in the cephalad-caudal direction. Screw loosening was defined as 1 mm displacement of the screw relative to bone, and the number of loading cycles to induce the screw loosening was obtained and statistically correlated with bone mineral density., RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between the number of loading cycles to induce screw loosening and bone mineral density (R = 0.8, P < 0.01). The average number of loading cycles to induce screw loosening was significantly less for specimens with bone mineral density < 0.45 g/cm2 compared to those with bone mineral density > or = g/cm2., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that bone mineral density may be a good predictor of anterior vertebral screw loosening.

Subjects were 35 adult male Caucasians (mean +/- SD; age: 39.1 +/- 14.0 yr, height: 180.6 +/- 5.3 cm, weight: 81.0 +/- 11.1 kg). %FAT, determined by HW with residual volume determined via O2 dilution, served as the criterion. DXA %FAT was determined by the Norland XR-26 (XR-26) bone densitometer and by the SF equations of Jackson and Pollock (JP) (1978), and Lohman (LOH) (1981). Criterion referenced validation included analyzing mean (+/- SD) %FAT values using a one-way ANOVA for significance, comparison of mean differences (MD), correlations (r), standard error of estimates (SEE), and total errors (TE). Significant differences were found between means of each method. The r (0.91) and SEE (3.0 %FAT) for DXA compare favorably with the established SF methods of JP and LOH for predicting %FAT; however, DXA demonstrated the largest MD (3.9 %FAT) and TE (5.2 %FAT). Regression analysis yields HW = 0.79* DXA + 0.56. The results do not support earlier research that found no significant difference between HW and DXA %FAT in males. The study suggests the density of the fat-free body (DFFB) is not constant, and that the variation in bone mineral content affects the DFFB, which contributes to the differences between DXA and HW %FAT. We recommend further research to identify inconsistencies between manufacturers of DXA equipment in prediction of %FAT in males.",ovid

The aim of this study is to quantitatively assess the effect of vertebral rotation on volumetric bone mineral density (v-BMD) and areal bone mineral density (a-BMD), further to propose the corrected strategies. To achieve this, a phantom, which was rotated from 0degree to 25degree in 5degree increments, was utilized. Bone mineral content (BMC), a-BMD, v-BMD, and projected area (p-AREA) were measured. The Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test or one-way ANOVA was used to examine the differences in variables between the different groups. The Pearson and Spearman correlation was used to test the relationships between quantitative parameters and rotated angles. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between angles and quantitative parameters. The findings indicate that, as the angle increased, a-BMD and v-BMD decreased (P < 0.001) , and the p-AREA increased (P < 0.001), but the BMC stays constant. The rotated angle was negative correlated (r = - 0.925, P < 0.001) with a-BMD and v-BMD (r = - 0.880, P < 0.001), positive (r = 0.930, P = < 0.001) correlated with p-AREA. The linear regression analysis showed that a-BMD = 0.808-0.01 x Angle and v-BMD = 151.808-1.588 x Angle. This study showed that, axial rotation might lead to a lower measured for a-BMD and v-BMD, it should be modified. This gives clinicians some insights into how to deal with osteoporosis in scoliosis patients. It's essential for clinicians to incorporate these findings into their diagnostic processes to prevent potential misdiagnosis and over-treatment of osteoporosis. Copyright © 2024.

There are sparse data on the prevalence of OP among this specific population. Moreover, LDD can falsely elevate the bone mineral density measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), leading to unreliable diagnostic results. Computed tomography (CT) Hounsfield unit (HU) values can help identify osteoporotic patients undetected by DXA., METHODS: A total of 479 patients aged>=50 years undergoing lumbar fusion for LDD were reviewed. The diagnosis of OP using DXA was based on World Health Organization criterion. The criterion for OP diagnosed on CT scan was the L1-HU value<=110., RESULTS: The prevalence of OP diagnosed on lumbar DXA, hip DXA, and both was 32.4%, 19.6%, 39.7%, respectively. The females had higher prevalence of OP diagnosed on DXA (spine and hip) than males (48.9% vs. 27.1%, P < 0.001). In females but not males, the prevalence of OP significantly increased with age (females, 50-59: 28.0%, 60-69: 58.1%, >=70: 78.8%, P < 0.001). Patients having primary diagnosis of degenerative lumbar scoliosis had the higher prevalence of OP than the rest patients (56.5% vs. 36.8%, P = 0.002). Among the 324 patients diagnosed with non-OP by lumbar DXA, the prevalence of OP diagnosed on CT scan was 25.9%, it increased with age and was also highest in patients with degenerative lumbar scoliosis., CONCLUSION: OP was quite common among patients aged>=50 years undergoing lumbar fusion for LDD, especially for females aged>=60 years or patients having degenerative lumbar scoliosis. Older patients or patients having degenerative lumbar scoliosis are more likely to have unreliable lumbar T-scores. Measurements of HU values can help identify more osteoporotic patients in this population., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.",ovid

Moreover, low MM defined by DEXA (net reclassification improvement: 0.58, P < 0.001), but not BIA (net reclassification improvement: -0.005, P = 0.975), provides incremental prognostic predictability when considered with pre-existing risk factors and brain natriuretic peptide level at discharge., CONCLUSIONS: In elderly hospitalized patients with heart failure, low MM defined by DEXA and BIA show significant discordance. The MM defined by DEXA, but not BIA, provides additional prognostic value to pre-existing prognostic models. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2022; 22: 610-615. Copyright © 2022 Japan Geriatrics Society.",ovid

Notably, natural molecules can increase BMD and exert pro-osteogenic effects. Noteworthily, the nutraceutical BlastiMin Complex R (Mivell, Italy, European Patent Application EP4205733A1) can induce differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in osteoblasts and can exert in vitro pro-osteogenic and anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, the purpose of this study was to verify the effects of BlastiMin Complex R on bone turnover markers (BTMs) and BMD in patients with senile and postmenopausal osteopenia or osteoporosis. The efficacy of BlastiMin Complex R on BTMs in serum was evaluated through biochemical assays. BMD values were analyzed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (R.E.M.S.) techniques, and the SNPs with a role in osteoporosis development were evaluated by PCR. Clinical data obtained after 12 months of treatment showed an increase in bone turnover index, a decrease in C-reactive protein levels, and a remarkable increase in P1NP levels, indicating the induction of osteoblast proliferation and activity in the cohort of 100% female patients recruited for the study. These findings show that the nutraceutical BlastiMin Complex R could be used as an adjuvant in combination with synthetic drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis pathology.",ovid

However, previous techniques to measure Hounsfield units (HUs) within the proximal femur demonstrate less successful correlation with DEXA results. An effective method of measuring HUs of the proximal femur from CT colonoscopy might allow for opportunistic osteoporosis screening., QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Do proximal femur HU measurements from CT colonoscopy correlate with proximal femur DEXA results? (2) How effective is our single HU measurement technique in estimating the likelihood of overall low BMD? (3) Does the relationship between our comprehensive HU measurement and DEXA results change based on age, sex, or time between studies?, METHODS: This retrospective study investigated the measurement of HU of the femur obtained on CT colonoscopy studies compared with DEXA results. Between 2010 and 2017, five centers performed 9085 CT colonoscopy studies; of those, 277 (3%) also had available DEXA results and were included in this study, whereas 8809 (97%) were excluded for inadequate CT imaging, lack of DEXA screening, or lack of proximal femur DEXA results. The median number of days between CT colonoscopy and DEXA scan was 595 days; no patient was excluded based on time between scans because bone remodeling is a long-term process and this allowed subgroup analysis based on time between scans. Two reviewers performed HU measurements at four points within the proximal femur on the CT colonoscopy imaging and intraclass correlation coefficients were used to evaluate interrater reliability. We used Pearson correlation coefficients to compare the comprehensive (average of eight measurements) and a single HU measurement with each DEXA result-proximal femur BMD, proximal femur T-score, femoral neck BMD, and femoral neck T-score-to identify the best measurement technique within this study.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the adaptive remodeling of the periprosthetic cortical bone after insertion of a tumor prosthesis with cemented stem., METHODS: A prospective study of 21 patients (F/M = 12/9), mean age 55 years (range 15-81) with metastatic bone disease (n = 9), sarcomas (n = 8) or aggressive benign tumors (n = 4) who underwent bone resection due to a tumor, and reconstruction with a tumor-prosthesis (Zimmer R Segmental 130 mm straight fluted cemented stem with trabecular metal (TM) collars) in the proximal femur (n = 10), distal femur (n = 9) or proximal tibia (n = 2). Measurements of bone mineral density (BMD) (g/cm2) were done postoperatively and after 3, 6, and 12 months using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. BMD was measured in 4 regions of interest around the cemented stem and in one region of interest 1 cm proximal from the ankle joint of the affected limb and measurement of the contralateral ankle was used as reference. Repeated measures ANOVA and students paired t-test was used to evaluate BMD changes over time., RESULTS: At 1-year follow-up, BMD decreased compared to baseline in all four regions of interest with a statistically significant bone loss of 8-15%. The bone loss was most pronounced (14-15%) in the 2 regions of interest closest to the trabecular metal (TM) collar and lowest (8%) adjacent to the tip of the stem., CONCLUSION: After 1 year the decrease in bone mineral density of the ankle on the affected limb was 9% and the contralateral ankle was close to baseline, thus suggesting that the periprosthetic bone mineral density changes during follow-up, mainly are caused by stress shielding and immobilization., TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was approved by the Scientific Ethical Committee of the Capital Region of Denmark (J.

One reason might be the composite measure of height which may add heterogeneity and noise. The aim of this study was to conduct a genome-wide linkage scan to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for lengths of spine, femur, tibia, humerus and radius. These were investigated as alternative measures for height in a large, population-based twin sample with the potential to find genes underlying bone size and bone diseases. 3,782 normal Caucasian females, 18-80 years old, with whole body dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) images were used. A novel and reproducible method, linear pixel count (LPC) was used to measure skeletal sizes on DXA images. Intraclass correlations and heritability estimates were calculated for lengths of spine, femur, tibia, humerus and radius on monozygotic (MZ; n = 1,157) and dizygotic (DZ; n = 2,594) twins. A genome-wide linkage scan was performed on 2000 DZ twin subjects. All skeletal sites excluding spine were highly correlated. Intraclass correlations showed results for MZ twins to be significantly higher than DZ twins for all traits. Heritability results were as follows: spine, 66%; femur, 73%; tibia, 65%; humerus, 57%; radius, 68%. Results showed reliable evidence of highly suggestive linkage on chromosome 5 for spine (LOD score = 3.0) and suggestive linkage for femur (LOD score = 2.19) in the regions of 105cM and 155cM respectively. We have shown strong heritability of all skeletal sizes measured in this study and provide preliminary evidence that spine length is linked to the chromosomal region 5q15-5q23.1. Bone size phenotype appears to be more useful than traditional height measures to uncover novel genes. Replication and further fine mapping of this region is ongoing to determine potential genes influencing bone size and diseases affecting bone.",ovid

Currently, there are no reference values available for GE-Healthcare DXA systems and it is known that whole-body and regional fat mass measures differ by DXA manufacturer., OBJECTIVE: To develop reference values by age and sex for DXA-derived fat mass measurements with GE-Healthcare systems., METHODS: A de-identified sample of 3,327 participants (2,076 women, 1,251 men) was obtained from Ball State University's Clinical Exercise Physiology Laboratory and University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Physical Activity & Health Research Laboratory. All scans were completed using a GE Lunar Prodigy or iDXA and data reported included percent body fat (%BF), fat mass index (FMI), and ratios of android-to-gynoid (A/G), trunk/limb, and trunk/leg fat measurements. Percentiles were calculated and a factorial ANOVA was used to determine differences in the mean values for each variable between age and sex., RESULTS: Normative reference values for fat mass variables from DXA measurements obtained from GE-Healthcare DXA systems are presented as percentiles for both women and men in 10-year age groups.

The results were combined with previous data obtained in 13 piglets, and two correction equations were determined according to fat mass content. Close to birth, 106 healthy appropriate-for-gestational-age preterm and term infants were scanned by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry to determine bone mineral content, bone area, and fat mass. Fat mass content determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was corrected using the equations obtained in piglets after which lean body mass was recalculated., RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry body weight was the best predictor of bone mineral content (r2 = 0.94), bone area (r2 = 0.95), lean body mass (r2 = 0.98), and fat mass (r2 = 0.84).

Body composition (adipose and lean tissue) was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in the total body and in the abdomen, the arms and the legs. Regional and total body fat correlated inversely with the performance at an incremental treadmill exercise test (-0.61 < r < -0.52, P < 0.0001), and the fat percentage in the abdomen and in the legs was 42% and 36% lower in the elite runners in comparison with the non-running controls.

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a means of determining body composition and body fat distribution at different sites including whole body and trunk-locations where there tends to be high correlation at an individual level., METHODS: We performed an analysis of DXA-derived metrics of adiposity (truncal fat %,subtotal fat % and total fat %) from the NHANES database and then correlated the findings with markers of insulin resistance. We analyzed the data from DXA scans in NHANES 1999-2004. Homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance and HOMA-beta (beta-cell function) were estimated. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated (rho) between HOMA-IR,HOMA-beta and different measures of obesity (Waist circumference(in cm), Body Mass Index (kg/m2), truncal fat %, subtotal fat % as well as total fat %) to gauge the relationship between markers of glucose homeostasis and DXA derived metrics of obesity. We also performed logarithmic transformation of HOMA-IR as well as HOMA-beta to ensure normality of distribution and to meet the criteria for regression analysis. A forward selection model (by outcome and gender) was performed to predict log transformed insulin resistance (log HOMA-IR) as well as log transformed HOMA-beta (log HOMA-beta,measure of beta cell function) from age, serum triglycerides, HDL, trunk fat % and the SBP (in both males and females separately), after reviewing the spearman correlation coefficients., RESULTS: There were a total of 6147 men and 6369 women who were part of the study cohort.

Besides that, radiographic osteophytes are strongly associated with BMD. Because of these reasons, the aim of the study was to investigate the possible association between radiological subchondral bone cyst (SBC) grade and systemic BMD and vitamin D status in the postmenopausal female patients with knee OA in a crosss-sectional study., METHODS: This study included of 48 osteoporosis treatment-free postmenopausal patients diagnosed with symptomatic medial compartment knee OA. BMD analysis was performed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and serum vitamin D levels were measured after recording patients' findings. Each knee was scanned using computed tomography (CT), and categorical SBC scores were graded for the medial and lateral tibiofemoral (TF) and patellofemoral (PF) compartments and further calculated as compartmental total, total TF and grand total of both TF compartments. SBC scores were analysed with correlation analysis., RESULTS: The patient population was characterized by radiographic joint space narrowing, obesity and low vitamin D status. Median medial total and grand total TF SBC scores were significantly different between the patient groups according to the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) radiographic grading (p = 0.006 and p = 0.007, respectively). There were no correlations between femoral BMD values and SBC scores. However, positive correlations were detected significantly between L1 - 4 DXA values and TF SBC scores, but not with PF SBC scores (p = 0.005 for the correlation between L1 - 4 BMD and medial compartments total TF SBC score, p = 0.021 for the correlation between L1 - 4 BMD and grand total TF SBC score). No significant correlations were found with Vitamin D levels., CONCLUSIONS: Development of TF OA high-grade SBCs may be linked to systemic bone mass as represented by trabecular bone-rich lumbar vertebrae. The relationship might point to the importance of bone stiffness as an acting factor in knee OA possibly with mechanical energy transfer to the joint. Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).",ovid

Reproducibility was expressed as smallest detectable difference (SDD), coefficient of variation (CV), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Sources of variation were investigated by multilevel analysis., RESULTS: The median interval between measurements was 0 days (range 0-45). The mean difference (SD) between the measurements (g/cm(2)) was -0.001 (0.02) and -0.0004 (0.02) at L1-4 and the total hip, respectively.

In a repeated DXA scan a BMD change exceeding 2 radical 2CV (%), the least significant change (LSC), or the SDD should be regarded as significant. Use of the SDD is preferable to use of the CV and LSC (%) because of its independence from BMD and its expression in absolute units.

The follow-up rate in both periods was 100%. First, the changes in BMD and TBS before and after surgery were compared between patients grouped by sex and obesity degree. Secondly, the correlations between the TBS or BMD and body composition 1 year after surgery were analyzed., RESULTS: The BMD and TBS were within the normal range after bariatric surgery. Changes in the BMD and TBS were related to time, the degree of obesity and sex. Changes in the TBS were closely related to changes in the BMD, and the trends in the changes in the BMD were basically the same among the different groups of individuals with obesity of different sexes.

These findings indicate COMP may be a predictor of BF% and FM. Age and running discipline appear predictors of bone health markers. Such findings may enable medical and sport science practitioners to tailor interventions relating to realization of training adaptations, performance, and health.

Thirty healthy age and sex-matched volunteers were enrolled as controls. Whole-body DXA and hand-grip dynamometer were used to measure muscle mass, grip strength and diagnose sarcopenia (EWGSOP2 criteria). Relationships between the results of strength in 12 muscles, functional tests, patient-reported disability, IMACS damage score, and history of the disease were assessed. The serum levels of potential molecular actors in the damage were measured., RESULTS: DXA and grip strength measurements took <=20 min. Both muscle mass and grip strength were decreased in IM patients vs volunteers (-10% and -30%, respectively) with a dispersion that varied widely (interquartile range -24.3% to +7.8% and -51.3% to -18.9%, respectively). Muscle mass and grip strength were non-redundantly correlated (r up to 0.6, P = 0.0001) with strength in 14 muscles (manual muscle test and hand-held dynamometer), functions (of limbs, respiratory and deglutition muscles), patient-reported disability, damage (extension and severity in muscular and extra-muscular domains) and blood levels of several myokines. Seven IM patients (17.5%) were sarcopenic. They had the worst damage, impaired functions, disability and history of severe myopathy. Decreased irisin and osteonectin levels were associated with sarcopenia (area under the curve 0.71 and 0.80, respectively)., CONCLUSION: DXA and hand-grip dynamometer are useful tools to assess damage in IM. Irisin and osteonectin may play a role in IM damage pathogenesis. Copyright © The Author(s) 2024. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Rheumatology.

The correlation between measurements of muscle mass and of muscle strength was also investigated., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients eligible for liver transplantation were studied. Lumbar skeletal muscle cross-sectional area was measured by CT and muscle depletion was defined using previously published cut-offs. Mid-arm muscle circumference was calculated following anthropometric measures. The Fat-Free Mass Index and the Appendicular Skeletal Muscle Index were calculated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Muscle strength was evaluated using the Hand Grip test., RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients with cirrhosis were included. Sarcopenia was diagnosed in 76% of the patients according to CT evaluation. A significant reduction in Fat-Free Mass Index and Appendicular Skeletal Muscle Index was observed in 42-52% of the patients, whereas 52% showed a mid-arm muscle circumference less than 10th percentile. Skeletal muscle mass evaluation through CT was only weakly correlated with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and anthropometry evaluation. No correlation was observed between CT measurement of muscle mass and Hand Grip test., CONCLUSION: CT scan can identify the highest percentage of sarcopenia in cirrhosis and no other techniques are actually available as a replacement. Future efforts should focus on approaches for assessing both skeletal muscle mass and function to provide a better evaluation of sarcopenia in cirrhotic patients.",ovid

Fat tissue-related systemic inflammation acts as the link to periodontal comorbidities of obesity. However, the BMI is unable to distinguish fat and fat-free tissues. More precise measures are required to evaluate body composition, including fat and fat-free tissues. This study aimed to determine the sex differences in the association between dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-measured body composition (i.e., fat mass and muscle mass) and phenotypes with periodontitis., METHODS: Cross-sectional data of 3892 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) study 2011-2014 were analyzed. Adiposity indices (fat mass index [FMI] and percentage body fat [%BF]) and muscle mass index (MMI) were calculated. The participants were categorized by the quintiles of FMI, MMI, and %BF. Body composition phenotypes were categorized as: low adiposity-low muscle (LA-LM), low adiposity-high muscle (LA-HM), high adiposity-low muscle (HA-LM), or high adiposity-high muscle (HA-HM), respectively. Periodontitis was defined by the CDC/AAP (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/American Academy of Periodontology) criteria. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted, stratified by sex. We further adjusted for white blood cell (WBC) counts in the sensitivity analysis., RESULTS: Restricted cubic splines revealed non-linear associations between body composition indices and periodontitis risk. Women with a higher FMI (odds ratio for Q5 vs. Q1 [ORQ5vs1] = 1.787, 95% confidence interval: 1.209-2.640) or %BF (ORQ5vs1 = 2.221, 1.509-3.268) had increased odds of periodontitis. In addition, women with HA-LM phenotype were more likely to develop periodontitis (OR = 1.528, 1.037-2.252). Interestingly, the WBC count, a systemic inflammatory biomarker, attenuated these associations. No statistically significant associations were found in men., CONCLUSIONS: The association between DXA-measured body composition and phenotypes with periodontitis differs per sex.

Factors that may contribute to osteomalacia, rickets, and poor bone healing include low (25[OH]D) and low BMD., METHODS: Patients were seen at the Nebraska Spine Center between 2008 and 2010. Selection criteria included a diagnosis of pars fracture with DXA Z-score values (lumbar and hip) and pretreatment serum (25[OH]D) level measurement. Twenty-four patients were included. Vitamin D was defined as sufficient when >= 32 ng/mL, insufficient when 20 to < 32 ng/mL, and deficient when < 20 ng/mL. BMD was interpreted from DXA Z-scores using reference intervals defined in the literature. A Z-score <-2.0 was considered low for chronological age., RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) vitamin D level was 29.9 ng/mL +/- 10.8 (range, 9-56 ng/mL). Values were <= 10 ng/mL in 1 patient (4%), 11-20 ng/mL in 4 patients (17%), 21-30 ng/mL in 8 patients (33%), 31-50 ng/mL in 10 patients (42%), and > 50 ng/mL in 1 patient (4%). This correlated to 3 (13%) patients with deficient vitamin D (<= 15 ng/mL), 12 (50%) patients with insufficient levels, and 9 (38%) with sufficient levels of vitamin D. The mean Z-scores were 0.43 +/- 0.93 (lumbar, range, -1.3 to 2.8) and 1.0 +/- 1.11 (hip, range, -0.5 to 3.0). All scores were consistent with normal bony mineralization for age., CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these data, we recommend routine vitamin D testing and do not recommend routine DXA in adolescents with lumbar stress fractures of the pars interarticularis.",ovid

The aim of this study was to examine the usefulness of a commercially available body composition meter using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) by comparing its measurement results with those obtained from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The participants were 443 children aged from 10 to 14 years (226 boys and 217 girls). Fat mass, fat-free mass, lean body mass, percentage of body fat, and bone mineral contents were evaluated for all participants using BIA and DXA. The agreement in the anthropometric data obtained from both devices was analyzed using correlation analysis, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), Bland-Altman plots, and ordinary least products regression analysis. Equivalence between both devices was tested by two one-sided t-test. All measured indicators showed strong linear correlations between the two measurement systems (r, 0.853-1.000). Fat mass, fat-free mass, and lean body mass showed absolute concordance (ICC, 0.902-0.972; Lin's CCC, 0.902-0.972). BIA overestimated bone mineral content (62.7-66.5%) and underestimated percentage of body fat (- 8.9 to - 0.8%), lean body mass (- 3.5 to - 1.8%), and body mass (- 0.8 to - 0.5%). For fat mass and fat-free mass, the overestimate or underestimate varied according to the sex and statistical analysis test. Bland-Altman analysis and ordinary least products analysis showed fixed bias and proportional bias in all indicators. Results according to quartiles of body mass index showed poor agreement for fat mass and percentage of body fat in both boys and girls in the lowest body mass index quartile. The present results revealed strong linear correlations between BIA and DXA, which confirmed the validity of the present single-frequency BIA-derived parameters. Our results suggest that BIA cannot provide the exact same values as DXA for some body composition parameters, but that performance is sufficient for longitudinal use within an individual for daily health management and monitoring.

Our aim was to compare treatments and outcomes of children with medical complexity undergoing spinal fusion in those who had dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans versus those who did not in an effort to standardize the workup of these patients before undergoing spinal surgery., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with low BMD who underwent spinal fusion at a tertiary care pediatric hospital between 2004 and 2016. We consulted with a pediatric endocrinologist to create standard definitions for low BMD to classify each subject. Regardless of DXA status, all patients were given a clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis [at least 2 long bone or 1 vertebral pathologic fracture(s)], osteopenia (stated on radiograph or by the physician), or clinically low bone density belonging to neither category. The last classification was used for patients whose clinicians had documented low bone density not meeting the criteria for osteoporosis or osteopenia. Fifty-nine patients met the criteria, and 314 were excluded for insufficient follow-up and/or not meeting a diagnosis definition. BMD Z -scores compare bone density ascertained by DXA to an age-matched and sex-matched average. Patients who had a DXA scan were also given a DXA diagnosis of low bone density (<=-2 SD), slightly low bone density (-1.0 to -1.9 SD), or neither (>-1.0 SD) based on the lowest BMD Z -score recorded., RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients were analyzed. Fifty-four percent had at least 1 DXA scan preoperatively. Eighty-one percent of DXA patients received some form of treatment compared with 52% of non-DXA patients ( P =0.03)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients referred for DXA scans were more likely to be treated for low BMD, although there is no standardized system in place to determine which patients should get scans.

Our study aims to develop a body composition-based risk score and integrate it into the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) to improve CVD prediction among well-functioning older adults. We included 1882 older adults from the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) study to screen body composition variables obtained from the Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Three models were developed and compared: the 4-DXA model, the refit FRS, and the refit FRS plus 4-DXA model. C-statistics were 0.62 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.65) for the refit FRS, 0.58 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.61) for the 4-DXA model, and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.66) for the refit FRS plus 4-DXA model. Compared to the refit FRS, the refit FRS plus 4-DXA model slightly improved CVD outcome prediction as the discrimination slope, net reclassification index, and the integrated discrimination index were 0.053 (95% CI: 0.041, 0.066), 0.098 (95% CI = - 0.0033, 0.20) and 0.013 (95% CI: 0.0069-0.019). This study provides a model for more accurate risk stratification and draws more attention on DXA-based indices in the clinical setting. It also encourages further research in validating the developed risk score in more diverse population and in investigating a broader range of CVD risk factors. Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).",ovid

However, the impact of structured reporting on reporting efficiency has not been thoroughly evaluted yet. The aim of this study was to compare reporting times and report quality of structured reports (SR) to conventional free-text reports of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry exams (DXA)., METHODS: FTRs and SRs of DXA were retrospectively generated by 2 radiology residents and 2 final-year medical students. Time was measured from the first view of the exam until the report was saved. A random sample of DXA reports was selected and sent to 2 referring physicians for further evaluation of report quality., RESULTS: A total of 104 DXA reports (both FTRs and SRs) were generated and 48 randomly selected reports were evaluated by referring physicians. Reporting times were shorter for SRs in both radiology residents and medical students with median reporting times of 2.7 min (residents: 2.7, medical students: 2.7) for SRs and 6.1 min (residents: 5.0, medical students: 7.5) for FTRs. Information extraction was perceived to be significantly easier from SRs vs FTRs (P < 0.001). SRs were rated to answer the clinical question significantly better than FTRs (P < 0.007). Overall report quality was rated significantly higher for SRs compared to FTRs (P < 0.001) with 96% of SRs vs 79% of FTRs receiving high or very high-quality ratings. All readers except for one resident preferred structured reporting over free-text reporting and both referring clinicians preferred SRs over FTRs for DXA., CONCLUSIONS: Template-based structured reporting of DXA might lead to shorter reporting times and increased report quality.",ovid

However, DXA is affected by a number of factors. In order to delay decompositional processes, human specimens for biomechanical studies are usually stored at about -20 degrees C; similarly, bone mineral density measurements are usually performed in the frozen state. The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of bone temperature on the measured bone mineral density., METHODS: Using DXA, bone mineral density measurements were taken in 19 fresh-frozen human femora, in the frozen and the thawed state. Water was used to mimic the missing soft tissue around the specimens. Measurements were taken with the specimens in standardized internal rotation. Total-BMD and single-BMD values of different regions of interest were used for evaluation., RESULTS: Fourteen of the 19 specimens showed a decrease in BMD after thawing. The measured total-BMD of the frozen specimens was significantly (1.4%) higher than the measured BMD of the thawed specimens., CONCLUSION: Based on our findings we recommend that the measurement of bone density, for example prior to biomechanical testing, should be standardized to thawed or frozen specimens. Temperature should not be changed during measurements. When using score systems for data interpretation (e.g. T- or Z-score), BMD measurements should be performed only on thawed specimens.",ovid

This study was designed to compare the relative abilities of single-photon absorptiometry (SPA) and pQCT to reflect BMD of the proximal femur as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), an established predictor of osteoporotic hip fracture risk., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., SUBJECTS: A well-defined community-based sample of 129 skeletally healthy women aged 70-87 years., MEASUREMENTS: Radial BMD by SPA and pQCT and femoral BMD by DXA. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed relating the DXA measurements at the femoral neck and the trochanteric region with the values of SPA and pQCT., RESULTS: Approximately 38% of the variance in femoral neck BMD could be explained by BMD of the midradius assessed by SPA, in contrast to only 18-27% by pQCT. At the trochanter, 32% of BMD could be predicted by SPA as compared to 19-26% by pQCT. Moreover, according to multiple regression, prediction of femoral BMD by SPA was not enhanced by performing pQCT., CONCLUSIONS: Radial pQCT has little value as a screening tool to identify elderly women with low femoral BMD. Additional research is needed to determine whether or not pQCT will enhance fracture prediction beyond that obtainable from a density measurement by SPA.",ovid

In renal transplant recipients (RTRs) due to the hyperparathyroidism the non-dominant forearm is often utilized as a peripheral measurement site for dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements. The forearm is also the site of previous created distal arteriovenous fistulas (AVF). Although AVF remain patent long after successful transplantation, there are no data available concerning their impact on radial bone DXA measurements., METHODS: In this cross-sectional study we performed DXA in 40 RTRs with preexisting distal AVF (RTRs-AVF) to assess areal bone mineral density (aBMD) differences between both forearms (three areas) and compared our findings to patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD, n = 40), pre-emptive RTRs (RTRs-pre, n = 15) and healthy volunteers (n = 20). In addition, we assessed relevant demographic, biochemical and clinical aspects., RESULTS: We found a marked radial asymmetry between the forearms in RTRs with preexisting AVF. The radial aBMD at the distal AVF forearm was lower compared to the contralateral forearm, resulting in significant differences for all three areas analyzed: the Rad-1/3: median (interquartile range) in g/cm2, Rad-1/3: 0.760 (0.641-0.804) vs. 0.742 (0.642, 0.794), p = 0.016; ultradistal radius, Rad-UD: 0.433 (0.392-0.507) vs. 0.420 (0.356, 0.475), p = 0.004; and total radius, Rad-total: 0.603 (0.518, 0.655) vs. 0.599 (0.504, 0.642), p = 0.001). No such asymmetries were observed in any other groups. Lower aBMD in AVF forearm subregions resulted in misclassification of osteoporosis., CONCLUSIONS: In renal transplant recipients, a previously created distal fistula may exert a negative impact on the radial bone leading to significant site-to-site aBMD differences, which can result in diagnostic misclassifications.",ovid

The effects of abdominal fat content and anatomic changes on the results of DXA were assessed., RESULTS: Of the 43 patients, 88.3% were women, 11.7% were men, and the mean age was 55.6 years (range, 32-72). There was a significant relationship between the error in the measurement of T-scores with DXA and osteophytic new bone formation (P = 0.011). There were significant relationships between the error in detecting osteoporosis with DXA and osteophytic new bone formation, facet joint degeneration, and aortic calcification (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal fat content does not significantly affect T-scores. However, DXA can give false-negative results in detecting osteoporosis, especially in patients with osteophyte new bone formation, facet joint degeneration, and aortic calcifications, all conditions primarily in elderly patients. In these cases, it is more appropriate to use quantitative computed tomography instead of DXA. Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",ovid

In total, 107 subjects (55 female, 51.4%) aged 20-50 yrs with no respiratory disease were recruited. Respiratory function tests, anthropometric measurements and a DXA scan were performed. Partial correlation and linear regression analyses were used to explore the effect of adiposity and lean body mass on respiratory function. The majority of respiratory function parameters were significantly correlated with DXA and non-DXA measurements of body fat. Neither thoracic nor abdominal fat had a greater effect. There were some differences in the effect of adiposity between the sexes. Respiratory function was negatively associated with lean body mass in females but positively associated in males. This disappeared after adjustment in females but remained in males. The effects of thoracic and abdominal body fat on respiratory function are comparable but cannot be separated from one another.",ovid
JOUR,the effect of excessive fat tissue on the measure of bone mineral density by dual x-ray absorptiometry: the impact of substantial weight loss following sleeve gastrectomy,DXA only,10.1111/cpf.12584,"['Maimoun, Laurent', 'Mariano-Goulart, Denis', 'Jaussent, Audrey', 'Lefebvre, Patrick', 'Picot, Marie-Christine', 'Mahadea, Krishna', 'Boudousq, Vincent', 'Fouillade, Clemence', 'Nocca, David', 'Ben Bouallegue, Faycal']",2019,"PURPOSE: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is used in clinical routine to determine areal bone mineral density (aBMD). However, it is not clear whether excessive fat mass or substantial weight loss modify the aBMD measurements. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of soft tissue composition on aBMD measured by DXA using a clinical model (i.e. sleeve gastrectomy: SG) that induces substantial body weight loss., METHODS: Areal bone mineral density and body composition (fat mass: FM and lean tissue mass: LTM) were determined by DXA in 41 obese patients (33 women, 80.5%) just before SG and 1 month later., RESULTS: One month after SG, mean weight loss was -9.8 +/- 2.6 kg, with a significant decrease in LTM and FM (kg) ranging from -7.3% to -9.5%. The relative variation in aBMD was increased at the lumbar spine (2.45 +/- 3.44%) and decreased at the hip (-1.47 +/- 2.28%), whereas no variation was observed for the whole body and radius. The variation in aBMD at the lumbar spine was inversely correlated with variations in weight, whole-body FM and trunk FM, but not LTM., CONCLUSION: This study shows evidence of a potential effect of body composition, particularly FM, on aBMD. However, given the modest change in aBMD, which was close to the precision error of aBMD measurements, it appears that significant weight loss does not have a clinically significant impact on the evaluation of aBMD using DXA.

The goal herein was to test how altered postures affect diagnostic metrics (i.e., standard clinical metrics and a newer image processing tool) for femur positioning. A device was built to support cadaveric femurs and adjust their orientation in 3degree increments in flexion and internal/external rotation. Seven isolated femurs were scanned in six flexion postures (0degree (neutral) to 15degree of flexion) and eleven rotational postures (15degree external to 15degree internal rotation) while collecting standard clinical DXA-based measures for each scan. The fracture risk tool was applied to each scan to calculate fracture risk. Two separate one-way repeated measures ANOVAs (alpha = 0.05) were performed on the DXA-based measures and fracture risk prediction output. Flexion had a significant effect on T-score, Bone Mineral Density (BMD), and Bone Mineral Content (BMC), but not area, at angles greater than 12degree. Internal and external rotation did not have a significant effect on any clinical metric. Fracture risk (as assessed by the image processing tool) was not affected by either rotation mode. Overall, this suggests clinicians can adjust patient posture to accommodate discomfort if deviations are less than 12 degrees, and the greatest care should be taken in flexion. Furthermore, the tool is relatively insensitive to postural adjustments, and as such may be a good option for tracking risk over repeated patient scans.",ovid

While fracture risk is often assessed using T-scores derived from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans, these measures are not fully effective in identifying individuals at greatest risk. To address this, a Statistical Shape and Appearance Modeling (SSAM) tool was previously developed to analyze femur shape and BMD distribution and demonstrated superior fracture risk prediction compared to T-scores using hip DXA scans exported in JPG format. The present study aimed to evaluate whether changes in DXA-imaging protocol (hip protocol vs. High-Definition Instant Vertebral Assessment (IVA-HD)) may influence the image and the SSAM tool's fracture risk predictions. The effect of image file type (JPG vs. PNG) was also explored, as native formats such as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) cannot be readily exported or saved in large databases. DXA scans from 36 subjects and seven cadaveric femurs were analyzed across four imaging conditions (file types and imaging protocols). Structural Similarity Index Measures (SSIM) quantified image differences, and Bland-Altman plots assessed agreement in fracture risk predictions. Minimal differences were found in SSAM tool outputs across protocols and file types. Higher-resolution scans (IVA-HD) and lossless file types (PNG) did not improve the accuracy of risk predictions compared to the standard hip protocol in JPG format. These findings suggest that the SSAM tool is robust to variations in imaging conditions, supporting its use with standard DXA imaging protocols and file formats.",ovid
JOUR,the effect of neck flexion on measurement of spinal bone mineral density and the need to apply head positioners during dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry,DXA only,10.2967/jnmt.118.216275,"['Qutbi, Mohsen', 'Ghanbari, Sajad', 'Soltanshahi, Mehdi', 'Gorzi, Saba Karami', 'Shiravand, Yaser', 'Ranji, Shahla']",2020,"Our purpose was to investigate any potential effect of neck flexion on measurement of spinal bone mineral density (BMD) through further reduction of spinal lordosis and whether it is necessary to apply a head positioner, in addition to a leg positioner, during dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Methods: Fifty-nine patients with no significant history of spinal disorders were recruited. A bone densitometry scan of the spine was obtained for all patients using a standard leg positioner in the supine position. Then, another scan of the spine was conducted using a small subnuchal cushion to flex the neck and, thus, straighten and minimize the lumbar lordosis. Parameters including the area, bone mineral content, BMD, and T and z scores for each lumbar vertebra (L1-L4) and for the total spine were extracted from the 2 scans and compared. Results: The mean age of the patients was 55.53 y (+/-11.86 y); 53 (89.83%) were female and 6 (10.17%) male. A statistically significant difference was found between corresponding values for area, BMD in L4, and total spine. The percentage change from a scan without a cushion to one with a cushion was 1.20% for L4 and 0.58% for the total spine. The percentage BMD change was -0.64% for L4 and -0.34% for the total spine. A change in diagnosis-from normal to osteopenia-occurred for only 1 patient. Conclusion:  Use of a head positioner to flex the neck and thus minimize lumbar lordosis in dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry does not significantly affect the diagnosis or densitometric measurements from a clinical standpoint.

This study evaluated body composition by whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in patients with IBD and healthy controls to enable the value of formal body composition analysis to be judged., METHODS: Patients with IBD and sex/age-matched controls prospectively underwent full body composition assessment by DXA, assessment by BMI, eating questionnaires and handgrip strength. Disease activity was assessed by faecal calprotectin (active >=150 microg/g). A cohort undergoing biologic induction therapy were assessed at baseline and after >=13 weeks., RESULTS: Total fat mass was higher in 54 patients with IBD (56% Crohn's disease, 61% male) than in 30 controls (median 25.1 vs. 18.7 kg, P = 0.042). DXA offered little more than BMI. Low SMI was more common than in controls (15% vs. 0%, P = 0.027). A normal BMI was seen in many patients with low SMI and handgrip strength was a poor marker of change in SMI. Body composition was similar in 28 patients with active vs. 22 with inactive disease. However, SMI increased specifically by 9.7% ( P = 0.004) and BMI by 6.4% ( P = 0.012) in 9 responders to therapy., CONCLUSION: DXA identifies many patients with reduced SMI who are not detected by standard methodologies. While disease activity is not associated with low SMI, resolution of inflammation leads to improved SMI. The potential for recognition of such patients to influence therapeutic decisions underlines the need for DXA assessment in clinical practice. Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Twenty elite senior players from an English Super League rugby league team underwent a total-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan at 3 phases of a competitive season: preseason (February), midseason (June), and postseason (September). Body mass (BM), fat mass (FM), lean mass, percentage body fat, and bone mineral content (BMC) were reported at each phase. Between the start and midpoint of the season, BM, lean mass, FM, and body fat percentage showed no significant change (p > 0.05); however, BMC was significantly increased (+0.71%; 30.70 +/- 38.00 g; p < 0.05).

The significant changes in body composition seen over the latter stages of the competitive season may have implications for performance capabilities at this important stage of competition. An increase in FM and decrease in lean mass may have a negative effect on the power/BM ratio, and therefore may be a cause for concern for playing, coaching, and medical staff. Coaching and strength and conditioning staff should aim to prescribe appropriate training and nutritional practices with the aim of maintaining the players' optimal body composition until the conclusion of the competitive season, in order that performance capabilities are maximized over the entire competition period.",ovid

Our objective was to assess how often a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan should be performed by assessing time of progression to osteopenia/osteoporosis., METHODS: All DXA scans performed between 2000 and 2009 from HIV-infected patients with at least two DXA were included. Time to an event (osteopenia and osteoporosis) was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Strata (tertiles) were defined using baseline minimum T scores. Differences between strata in time to an event were compared with the log-rank test., RESULTS: Of 391 patients (1,639 DXAs), 49.6% had osteopenia and 21.7% osteoporosis at their first DXA scan. Of the 112 (28.6%) with normal BMD, 35.7% progressed to osteopenia; median progression time was 6.7 years. These patients were stratified: ""low-risk"" (baseline minimum T score >-0.2 SD), ""middle-risk"" (between -0.2 and -0.6 SD), and ""high-risk"" (from -0.6 to -1 SD); median progression time to osteopenia was 8.7, >7.2, and 1.7 years, respectively (p<0.0001).

The reference method for SM mass measurement is whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) appendicular lean mass (ALM) serves as an affordable and practical SM surrogate. Empirical equations, developed on relatively small and diverse samples, are now used to predict total body SM from ALM and other covariates; prediction models for extremity SM mass are lacking. The aim of the current study was to develop and validate total body, arm, and leg SM mass prediction equations based on a large sample (N = 475) of adults evaluated with whole-body MRI and DXA for SM and ALM, respectively. Initial models were fit using ordinary least squares stepwise selection procedures; covariates beyond extremity lean mass made only small contributions to the final models that were developed using Deming regression. All three developed final models (total, arm, and leg) had high R2s (0.88-0.93; all p < 0.001) and small root-mean square errors (1.74, 0.41, and 0.95 kg) with no bias in the validation sample (N = 95).

However, while several studies have investigated the abilities of obesity anthropometric measures in predicting CAD, only few studies have evaluated DXA as CAD predictor; particularly, a comparison between a model including information coming from anthropometric measurements and a model in which fat is precisely measured by DXA, is still lacking. In order to verify if CAD severity, as measured by Gensini score, is better predicted when a prognostic model includes DXA measurements rather than anthropometric measures, we compared performance obtained by two Bayesian Networks (BNs) including standard anthropometric measures and DXA, respectively., METHODS: Data come from 58 consecutive patients, 79% of them having suspected and 21% known CAD. Two BNs were implemented: input variables include anamnestic information, biochemical data and obesity measures. In the first model (BN1) obesity was measured by body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio, while in the second one (BN2) it is quantified by DXA-derived parameters., RESULTS: Network graphs and results coming from sensitivity analysis show that in both models lipoproteins and biomarkers of inflammation act as proximal node, while obesity (independently of the chosen measure) appears to be a distal node acting by the intermediation of other variables. Both models show high predictive abilities, the mean percentage classification errors being, respectively, 14.13 and 18.87., CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the BN predictive ability is slightly superior when obesity is measured using anthropometric data instead of DXA measurements. The reason probably relies on the fact that in the BN the obesity role in predicting CAD is mediated by the action of other factors that appear to be more directly influencing the outcome. Thus, the necessity to dispose of a perfect measure becomes less compulsory an",ovid

Urine specific gravity effect on total and segmental body composition validity of multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis compared with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. J Strength Cond Res 35(2): 373-384, 2021-The purposes were to compare body composition measures between a specific multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer (InBody770) and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and determine if hydration status within a specified range affected these measures. Methods included determining urine specific gravity before testing. Urine specific gravity needed to be within typical well-hydrated (n = 37), euhydrated (n = 45), or slightly dehydrated (n = 20) ranges. Segmental and total body composition measures were determined with the InBody770 and by DXA within the same testing session. Paired sample t-tests revealed significant differences (p < 0.005) between InBody770 and DXA for all body composition variables for all 3 hydration statuses, except for trunk fat-free mass (FFM) and trunk fat mass (FM) of the well-hydrated and euhydrated groups and right leg FM and trunk FFM of the slightly dehydrated group. For the total sample (n = 102), InBody770 significantly underestimated total body FM, right arm FFM, left arm FFM, right leg FFM, and left leg FFM with the range of underestimation being between 0.16 and 2.87 kg. The total body FFM by InBody770 was overestimated by 2.33 +/- 2.80 kg or 3.6%. Bland-Altman plots supported these results. The major conclusions are that differences between the InBody770 and DXA segmental and total body FFM and FM are not significantly affected by hydration status in the range investigated, and the FM and FFM determined by the 2 devices are generally significantly different.

JOUR,use of bioelectric impedance analysis and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry for monitoring the nutritional status of dialysis patients,DXA only,,"['Dumler, F']",1997,"Despite recent technological advances, inadequate nutrition has been clearly identified as a significant risk factor to survival of patients undergoing chronic maintenance dialysis therapy. Although body density by underwater weight and residual lung volume, total body water by isotope dilution, bone mineral content, and total body potassium measurements will provide a very accurate multicompartmental analysis of body composition, they are not applicable to routine clinical or field work. Because of availability and simplicity, in addition to anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry have received the most attention from the renal community. Several studies have validated the use of total body water by BEI as a surrogate for isotope dilution methods in dialysis patients, whereas others have established an excellent correlation with the volume of distribution of urea as measured by urea kinetic volume. Bioimpedance analysis has been extensively validated in stable healthy populations for measurement of lean body mass. Results are similar to those obtained with hydrodensitometry and total body potassium. Several studies in dialysis patients have compared lean body mass measurements by BEI and DEXA. Although the number of patients studied is relatively small, there is a high degree of correlation and concordance between the two methods. Nevertheless, selective equations for specific patient populations may be required with both methodologies for individual clinical applications. Longitudinal follow-up of body composition using BEI and DEXA in dialysis patients is contingent on a stable hydration status and/or accurate estimation of extracellular volume status for appropriate corrections. Consistency of technique and standardization of BEI and DEXA equipment is essential for reproducibility of results. Equations used in calculations must be age, sex, race, body habitus, and population specific whenever possible. Multiple compartment models including BEI, DEXA and isotopic dilution provide the best current ""gold standard"" for body composition analysis.

JOUR,"use of dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, the trabecular bone score and quantitative computed tomography in the evaluation of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorders",DXA only,10.1111/nep.13016,"['Pocock, Nicholas']",2017,"In subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who suffer a minimal trauma fracture, the problem is to differentiate between osteoporosis and the various forms of renal bone disease associated with CKD-mineral and bone disorder. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that renal osteodystrophy may coexist with osteoporosis. The World Health Organization's bone mineral density (BMD) criteria for osteopenia ( -2.5 < T-score < -1.0) and osteoporosis (a T-score <= -2.5) may be used in patients with CKD stages 1-3. In CKD stages 4-5, BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is less predictive and may underestimate fracture risk. The development of absolute fracture risk (AFR) algorithms, such as FRAX R and the Garvan absolute fracture risk calculator, to predict risk of fracture over a given time (usually 10 years) aims to incorporate non-BMD risk factors into the clinical assessment. FRAX R has been shown to be useful to assess fracture risk in CKD but may underestimate fracture risk in advanced CKD. The trabecular bone score is a measure of grey scale homogeneity obtained from spine DXA, which correlates to trabecular microarchitecture and is an independent risk factor for fracture. Recent data demonstrate the potential utility of the trabecular bone score adjustment of AFR through the FRAX R algorithm in subjects with CKD. Parameters of bone microarchitecture using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) or high-resolution pQCT are also able to discriminate fracture status in subjects with CKD. However, there are at present no convincing data that the addition of pQCT or high-resolution pQCT parameters to DXA BMD improves fracture discrimination. More advanced estimates of bone strength derived from measurements of micro-architecture, by QCT-derived finite element analysis may be incorporated into AFR algorithms in the future.

This study sought to determine how obesity and fat distribution measured by readily available anthropometric and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) methods is related to abdominal obesity assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)., METHODS: Men (n = 43) and women (n = 47), ages 55 to 75 years, were assessed for body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, waist circumference, and skin folds by anthropometric methods; for percentage of body fat by DXA; and for abdominal total, subcutaneous, and visceral fat by MRI., RESULTS: In stepwise regression models, the waist-to-hip ratio explained 50% of the variance in abdominal visceral fat among men (P <.01), and body mass index explained an additional 6% of the variance (P <.01). Among women, waist circumference was the only independent correlate of abdominal visceral fat, accounting for 52% of the variance (P <.01). Among men, the percentage of body fat was the only independent correlate of abdominal subcutaneous fat, explaining 65% of the variance (P <.01).

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the standard non-invasive method to assess BMD, but is not always widely available. Quantitative heel ultrasound (QUS) is a mobile, relatively inexpensive, easy to perform and radiation-free method which can predict fractures to the same extent as DXA. This study assessed the usefulness of QUS vs DXA in determining BMD in chronic haemodialysis patients., METHODS: Patients had their BMD at the hip and spine measured by DXA (Lunar Expert). QUS of the left heel (McCue CubaClinical II machine) measured broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) and velocity of sound (VOS). Correlations between DXA and QUS parameters were calculated. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for BUA and VOS and used to define cut-off points for calculating sensitivities and specificities for BUA and VOS. Femoral neck BMD was applied as the standard for diagnosing osteoporosis (T< or =-2.5) and osteopaenia (T>-2.5 and < or =-1) by WHO criteria., RESULTS: Eighty eight patients (45.5% women), mean age 58+/-17 years, were studied. A total of 19% and 49% had femoral neck BMDs in the 'osteoporosis' and 'osteopaenia' ranges, respectively. There were good correlations between hip BMD and QUS parameters (r=0.68-0.79, P<0.001). Areas under the ROC curves for BUA and VOS in diagnosing 'osteoporosis' were 0.86 and 0.80, respectively. BUA and VOS had sensitivities of 76 and 71% and specificities of 80 and 69%, respectively, for diagnosing 'osteoporosis'. The positive predictive values for BUA and VOS were 48 and 35%, respectively, and the negative predictive values were 93 and 91% respectively., CONCLUSIONS: DXA and QUS parameters were significantly correlated. However, sensitivities and specificities of QUS parameters were not sufficiently high for QUS to be used simply as an alternative to DXA. The relatively high negative predictive values suggest that QUS may reliably screen out patients unlikely to have a BMD in the osteoporotic range.

JOUR,utility of fat-free adipose tissue correction formula for tracking body composition changes with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry,DXA only,10.1111/cpf.12915,"['Moore, Sam R', 'Baker, Paul A', 'Smith-Ryan, Abbie E']",2025,"INTRODUCTION: Fat loss is often the target of weight loss interventions; however, preservation of lean soft tissue (LST) may be more important for health and weight maintenance. Though some LST loss may be inevitable when tracking body composition changes using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), correcting for the fat-free component of adipose tissue (FFAT) in DXA-derived LST (DXALST) has been proposed. This analysis sought to evaluate differences between DXALST and FFAT-corrected LST (FFATLST) amongst varied populations and interventions to understand application of the correction formula on LST outcomes., METHODS: 226 subjects were analyzed across five prior studies. Three studies evaluated combined nutrition and exercise (high-intensity interval training [HIIT] or high-intensity resistance training [HIRT]) interventions, including HIIT + HIRT with pre- and post-nutrient timing (HIITRT), HIIT + essential amino acids (HIITAA), and HIRT + protein (HIRTPRO). Remaining studies evaluated HIIT (HIITOW) and protein following bariatric surgery (BARPRO). Pre and post total body DXA scans were used to measure DXALST, body mass, and fat mass (FM). The correction formula was applied to calculate FFATLST. Paired sample t-tests were used to evaluate differences between DXALST and FFATLST change scores (DELTA) across all subjects, within each study and intervention., RESULTS: Significant differences between DELTADXALST and DELTAFFATLST were observed for BARPRO (mean difference [MD; DELTADXALST-DELTAFFATLST] +/- standard error [SE]: -3.5 +/- 1.2 kg, p < 0.001), as well as HIRTPRO (-0.1 +/- 0.2 kg, p = 0.004)., DISCUSSION: When evaluating LST, the FFAT correction may be specifically applicable to cases of significant weight loss (>10% of original weight) or body recomposition (>=2% FM loss and >=2% LST gain).

However, changes in bone density cannot be quantified by conventional radiography. This study aimed at developing a new technique for measurement of periarticular bone density at the knee joint by dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA) and assessing the precision of this technique for selected areas around the knee., METHODS: To validate this technique for bone density assessment in both patient and control subjects, knee joints from healthy subjects and patients with inflammatory arthritis were selected for study. Posteroanterior (PA) and lateral scans of both knees were acquired with the Hologic 4500 elite bone densitometer. Each scan was repeated three times, with repositioning between scans. Knee scans were obtained with the forearm software and evaluated by subregion analysis. Seven femoral and seven tibial subregions of interest (ROIs) were selected on PA scans. Six ROIs were selected on lateral scans. Precision was determined for each ROI selected., RESULTS: 14 knee joints were studied in each group. Precision, expressed as percentage coefficient of variation (CV%), varied widely between subregions. PA scans were most appropriate for measurement of femoral bone density (CV% = 1.89-2.64%), whereas the best value obtained for ROIs within the tibia was on the lateral scan, where CV% for measurement of the proximal 5 mm was 2.67% in the patient group. CV% for BMD of the patella was excellent at 0.84% in the patient group., CONCLUSION: This new application of DXA can be used to measure periarticular bone density at the knee joint.

The 2D:4D measurements were performed twice by two blinded raters. Intrarater and interrater reliability, as well as agreement between the X-ray and the DXA assessments, were tested., RESULTS: Intrarater reliabilities of both raters using X-ray with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of 0.97 and 0.90 were excellent. Using DXA, the ICCs were 0.90 and 0.91 thus also showing excellent reliability. Interrater reliabilities were excellent using both the X-ray (ICC of 0.94) and the DXA (ICC of 0.90), assessments respectively.

Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can be used to determine abdominal fat depots, being more accessible and less costly than gold standard measures such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). DXA has not been fully validated for use in South Asians. Here, we determined the accuracy of DXA for measurement of abdominal fat in an Indian population by comparison with MRI., DESIGN: 146 males and females (age range 18-74, BMI range 15-46 kg/m(2)) from Hyderabad, India underwent whole body DXA scans on a Hologic Discovery A scanner, from which fat mass in two abdominal regions was calculated, from the L1 to L4 vertebrae (L1L4) and from the L2 to L4 vertebrae (L2L4). Abdominal MRI scans (axial T1-weighted spin echo images) were taken, from which adipose tissue volumes were calculated for the same regions., RESULTS: Intra-class correlation coefficients between DXA and MRI measures of abdominal fat were high (0.98 for both regions). Although at the level of the individual, differences between DXA and MRI could be large (95% of DXA measures were between 0.8 and 1.4 times MRI measures), at the sample level, DXA only slightly overestimated MRI measures of abdominal fat mass (mean difference in L1L4 region: 2% (95% CI:0%, 5%), mean difference in L2L4 region:4% (95% CI: 1%, 7%)).

The purpose of the study is to determine the level of agreement between bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for assessing baseline and change in FFM and FM% after an exercise training intervention for individuals with mobility deficits after stroke. Fat-free mass and FM% were measured by BIA and DXA at the beginning and after 6 months of participation in an exercise program for individuals with mobility deficits after stroke. Forty-two subjects after stroke were included. Overall, Bland-Altman plots revealed that BIA overestimated the baseline FFM and FM% by only -0.4 +/- 1.8 kg and -2.8 +/- 1.8%, respectively. BIA underestimated changes in FFM by 0.33 +/- 0.45 kg and overestimated changes in FM% by -0.40 +/- 0.68%. The 95% CI of the mean bias for baseline FFM was -7.1 to 6.3 kg and -11.8 to 6.0% for FM%, demonstrating good agreement. The 95% CI for the change in FFM was -3.8 to 4.5 kg and -5.0 to 4.2% for FM%, which reflected good agreement. BIA is a good tool for assessing qualitative baseline and change in FFM and FM%. Body composition is important for the prescription and evaluation of rehabilitation programs designed for individuals after stroke. Our results provide clinicians and researchers with a better understanding of the utility of BIA to measure body composition at baseline and in response to exercise interventions in this population.

Results were stratified according to sex, age, and ethnicity., RESULTS: Prevalence of sarcopenic obesity ranged from 4.4% to 84.0% in men and from 3.6% to 94.0% in women. Prevalence was higher in men using definitions from Baumgartner (17.9% vs 13.3%, P < .001), Levine (14.2% vs 6.6%, P < .001), and Kim-1 (30.0% vs 9.3%, P < .001); lower for men using the Davison (4.4% vs 11.1%, P < .001) and Kim-2 (83.7% vs 94.0%) definitions; and the same for men and women using the Bouchard (45.3% vs 44.3%, P = .32) and Kim-3 (75.6% vs 77.0%, P = .51) definitions. For all but one definition, sarcopenic obesity increased with each decade and was lower in non-Hispanic blacks than whites., CONCLUSION: Prevalence of sarcopenic obesity in older adults varies up to 26-fold depending on current research definitions. Such a high degree of variability suggests the need to establish consensus criteria that can be reliably applied across clinical and research settings. © 2013, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2013, The American Geriatrics Society.",ovid

We evaluated the accuracy of semiautomatic computer determination of the detailed vertebral shape., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The shape and appearance of vertebrae on 250 lateral dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans were statistically modeled using a sequence of active appearance models of vertebral triplets. The models were matched to unseen scans given an approximate initial location of the center of each vertebra. The segmentation accuracy was analyzed by fracture grade., RESULTS: Segmentation accuracy comparable to manual precision was obtained in the case of normal vertebrae, but the accuracy decreased with increasing fracture severity. We propose methods for improving the robustness for severe fractures., CONCLUSION: Vertebral morphometry measurements may be substantially automated even on noisy data with multiple fractures present. The shape and appearance parameters of the models could provide more powerful quantitative classifiers of osteoporotic vertebral fracture.",ovid

Additionally, recently developed software allow to quantify visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Currently, there are no reference values available for GE Healthcare DXA systems for VAT. The aim of this study was to develop reference values for VAT in healthy European adults aged 20-30 years using a GE Healthcare Prodigy densitometer along with the dedicated CoreScan application. We also assessed the associations of VAT with traditional cardiometabolic risk factors. In 421 participants (207 men; 214 women), we performed DXA whole-body scans and calculated total body fat (BF) and VAT (in gender-specific percentiles). We also measured blood pressure and fasting glucose, insulin, and blood lipids. Males, in comparison with females, had 2-fold greater VAT both in units of mass (542 +/- 451 g; 95% CI: 479.6-605.1 g vs. 258 +/- 226 g; 95% CI: 226.9-288.6 g) and volume (570 +/- 468 cm3; 95% CI: 505.1-635.2 cm3 vs. 273 +/- 237 cm3; 95% CI: 240.6-305.3 cm3). They also had significantly higher the VAT/BF ratio. VAT showed a stronger positive correlation than BF with blood pressure, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, glucose, insulin, and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index and a stronger negative correlation with HDL-cholesterol. Among these variables, VAT had the highest area under the curve for triglycerides >=150 mg/dL (0.727 in males and 0.712 in females). In conclusion, we provide reference values for VAT obtained from healthy adults using the GE Healthcare DXA. These values may be useful in the diagnosis of visceral obesity, for identifying subjects with high obesity-related risks, in epidemiological studies, as a target for therapies, and in physically trained individuals. In both genders, VAT was associated with traditional cardiometabolic risk factors, particularly hypertriglyceridemia.",ovid

To calculate the vertebral volume using planar postero-anterior and lateral DXA values, several different geometrical approximations were used: cubic, cylindrical with a circular cross-section and cylindrical with an elliptical cross-section. The aim of this study was to compare these geometrical approximations with each other and with a reference standard, defined as the volume found on a computed tomographic (CT) scan. L2 and L3 were evaluated in a phantom study. Volume approximations by the cube or cylinder with circular cross-section geometry showed more than a 50% overestimation (range 54-74%). However, the elliptical cylinder approach showed very good agreement: 2.1% and 1.2% for L2 and L3, respectively, when compared to the CT volumes. In addition, we performed four patient studies with both CT and DXA to evaluate the elliptical cylinder estimate in a clinical setting. For L2 and L3, the mean relative difference was less than 2%. We conclude that the elliptical cylinder approach results in the most accurate bone volume estimates in both the phantom and patients.",ovid

Weight gain composition was calculated from the difference between the earlier and later measurement. The minimal detectable changes in whole body composition over time according to the variance of the population (within groups of 20 infants) and the minimal detectable changes according to the dietary intervention (between two groups of 20 infants) were determined at 5% significance and 80% power. Whole body composition was similar in the two groups at the initial measurement, but all the measured variables differed at the time of the second measurement. Formula-fed infants showed a greater weight gain (19.9 +/- 3.2 versus 15.9 +/- 2.2 g.kg(-1). d(-1), p < 0.05), fat mass deposition (5.1 +/- 1.9 versus 3.3 +/- 1.3 g.kg(-1). d(-1), p < 0.05), bone mineral content gain (289 +/- 99 versus 214 +/- 64 mg.kg(-1). d(-1), p < 0.05), and increase in bone area (1.6 +/- 0.4 versus 1.3 +/- 0.3 cm(2). kg(-1). d(-1), p < 0.05) compared with the fortified human milk group. From these data, a minimal increase from the first measurement of 111 g lean body mass, 68 g fat mass, and 3. 1 g bone mineral content is needed to be detectable in a longitudinal study that includes 20 infants. For significance between two groups of 20 infants around the time of discharge, dietary intervention needs to achieve minimal differences of 160 g lean body mass, 86 g fat mass, and 4.1 g bone mineral content. With respect to weight gain composition, the minimal differences required to reach significance are 2.1 g.kg(-1). d(-1) for gain in lean body mass, 1.2 g.kg(-1). d(-1) for gain in fat mass, and 76 mg.kg(-1). d(-1) for gain in bone mineral content.

The reliability of DXA has been examined extensively using a number of different methodological approaches. This study sets up to investigate the accuracy of measuring the parameters of body composition (BC) by means of the whole-body and the segmental DXA method analysis with the typical error of measurement (TEM) that allows for expressing the error in the units of measure. The research was implemented in a group of 63 participants, all of whom were university students. Thirty-eight males (22.6+/-2.9 years, average body mass 77.5+/-8.4 kg) and 25 females (21.4+/-2.0 years, average body mass 58.6+/-7.2 kg) were recruited. The measured parameters included body mass (BM), fat-free mass (FFM), body fat (BF), bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD). For the whole-body analysis, the determined TEM was: BM at the level of 0.12 kg in females and 0.29 kg in males; BF 0.25kg and 0.44% females, 0.52 kg and 0.66% males; FFM 0.24 kg females and 0.42 kg males; BMC 0.02 kg females and males; BMD 0.01g/cm2 females and males. The TEM values in the segmental analysis were: BF within the range of 0.04-0.28 kg and 0.68-1.20% in females, 0.10-0.36 kg and 0.72-1.94% in males; FFM 0.08-0.41 kg females and 0.17-0.86 males, BMC 0.00-0.02 kg females and 0.01-0.02 kg males in relation to the body segment (upper limb, trunk, lower limb). The BMD value was at the level of 0.01-0.02g/cm2. The study results showed high reliability in measuring body composition parameters using the DXA method. The whole-body analysis showed a higher accuracy of measurement than the segmental.

Total fat mass, regional fat mass, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) may be estimated with anthropometric measures, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The aim of our study was to assess which measurement correlated best with cardiometabolic risk factors in healthy nonobese postmenopausal women., METHODS: The CoLaus/OsteoLaus cohort included 1,500 postmenopausal women (age range 50-80). We analyzed correlations between: 1) measurements of body composition assessed by anthropometric measures, BIA, and DXA and 2) these measurements and different selected cardiometabolic risk factors, such as blood pressure, lipid markers (cholesterol subtypes and triglycerides), and metabolic markers (glucose, insulin, adiponectin, and leptin). Spearman correlation coefficient, stepwise forward regression, and linear regression analyses were used to determine association between anthropometric measurements and cardiometabolic risk factors., RESULTS: In the 803 included participants (mean age 62.0 +/- 7.1 y, mean body mass index 25.6 kg/m2 +/- 4.4), correlations between total fat mass measured by BIA and total fat mass, android fat, gynoid fat, or VAT measured by DXA are very strong (from r = 0.531, [99% confidence interval (CI), 0.443-0.610] to r = 0.704, [99% CI, 0.640-0.758]).

Quantifying visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in PCOS patients can be a tool to assess metabolic risk and monitor effects of treatment. The latest dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) technology can measure VAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in a clinical setting. Purpose To compare DXA-measurements of VAT and SAT with the gold standard MRI in women with PCOS. Material and Methods A cross-sectional study of 67 overweight women with PCOS was performed. Measurements of VAT and SAT were performed by DXA in a 5-cm thick transverse slice at the L4/L5 level and by MRI in a 1-cm thick transverse slice at the L3 level. Results Mean (SD) DXA-VAT was 81 (34) cm3, DXA-SAT was 498 (118) cm3, MRI-VAT was 117 (48) cm3, and MRI-SAT was 408 (122) cm3. MRI and DXA measures of VAT (r = 0.82, P < 0.001) and SAT (r = 0.92, P < 0.001) correlated closely, and DXA-VAT was stronger correlated with MRI-VAT than BMI (r = 0.62, P < 0.001) and waist circumference (r = 0.60, P < 0.001). DXA-VAT coefficient of variance was 6.7% and inter correlation coefficient was 0.98. Bland-Altman analyses showed DXA to slightly underestimate VAT and SAT measurements compared with MRI. Conclusion DXA and MRI measurements of VAT and SAT correlated closely despite different size of region of interest, and DXA-VAT was superior to waist circumference and BMI in estimating MRI-VAT. DXA showed high reproducibility making it is suitable for repeated measurements in the same individual over time.",ovid

Complementarias a un estudio DXA convencional, y plenamente validadas, se dispone de herramientas de estimación de riesgo de fractura a 10 años, tomando en cuenta los factores de riesgo más conocidos (FRAX) y el análisis de textura trabecular (TBS). El análisis geométrico estructural de cadera (HSA) aunque disponible, no está aún validado clínicamente. Aparte de DXA, cuyas limitaciones son, entre otras, que entregan una dosis de radiación ionizante (muy baja), analizan un área de hueso más que un volumen y que no diferencian entre hueso cortical y trabecular, se encuentran las imágenes radiológicas cuantitativas, como tomografía computada (QCT) y tomografía computada periférica de alta resolución (HR-pQCT) que también irradian al paciente (dosis mayores). Las técnicas sin radiación como ultrasonido cuantitativo (QUS), radiofrecuencia por ultrasonido (REMS) y resonancia magnética cuantitativa (QMRI), en mayor o menor medida aportan un análisis tridimensional o volumétrico, de alta resolución, permitiendo diferenciar entre hueso cortical y trabecular y aumentando la especificidad del diagnóstico. La principal limitación de estas nuevas tecnologías es su alto costo, poca disponibilidad y, en algunos casos, falta de validación clínica en grandes poblaciones.

After resection, femora were imaged by nondestructive ex vivo specimen microCT at three voxel sizes (31 micro, 16 micro, 8 micro) and DXA, and then sectioned for histomorphometric analysis of mineralized bone. Bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular parameters (number, TbN; separation, TbSp; thickness, TbTh) and mineralized bone volume/total bone volume (BV/TV) were compared and correlated among imaging methods and histomorphometry. Statistical tests were considered significant if P<0.05. Ten weeks post inoculation, diaphyseal BMD increased in the femur with tumor compared to the opposite femur by all modalities (p<0.005, n = 11). Diaphyseal BMD by in vivo microCT correlated with ex vivo 31 and 16 microm microCT and histomorphometry BV/TV (r = 0.91-0.94, P<0.001, n = 11). DXA BMD correlated less with bone histomorphometry (r = 0.73, P<0.001, n = 11) and DXA did not distinguish trabeculae from cortex. By in vivo and ex vivo microCT, trabecular BMD decreased (P<0.05, n = 11) as opposed to the cortex. Unlike BMD, trabecular morphologic parameters were threshold-dependent and when using ""fixed-optimal-thresholds,"" all except TbTh demonstrated trabecular loss with tumor and correlated with histomorphometry (r = 0.73-0.90, P<0.05, n = 11)., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Prostate cancer involving the skeleton can elicit a host bone response that differentially affects the cortex compared to trabeculae and that can be quantified noninvasively in vivo and nondestructively ex vivo.",ovid

Repeatability was assessed by scanning each carcass 10 times sequentially in the same position. Reproducibility was assessed by scanning each carcass in 10 different positions. Images were analyzed with DXA software using a custom region of interest (ROI) and the standard head, trunk, arm, and leg ROI. Predicted values from the DEXA for bone mineral content (BMC), bone area, bone mineral density (BMD), total weight, soft-tissue weight, fat-tissue weight, and lean-tissue weight were considered. Repeatability was associated with the variance between measurements on the same carcass in the same position (repeatability conditions). An average variance value was obtained with all the carcasses combined, and the SD was calculated as the square root of this combined variance. The CV was the ratio between the SD of the measurements and its average value. Reproducibility was calculated for each carcass as the difference between the variance obtained under the reproducibility conditions and that obtained under the repeatability conditions. The effects of the ROI and conditions were evaluated by ANOVA and Tukey's test. Means of BMC, bone area, BMD, fat tissue, and lean tissue differed among the ROI (P < 0.05) in both the repeatability and reproducibility conditions. The CV of DXA measurements under repeatability condition obtained in the head, arm, and leg ROI was lesser than 1%. Only the repeatability errors of fat tissue differed (P < 0.05) among the ROI, with the lowest precision found for the trunk ROI. The reproducibility errors of BMC, bone area, fat tissue, and lean tissue differed (P < 0.05) among the ROI. The custom ROI had reproducibility errors greater than 2% for fat tissue and greater than 3.5% for BMC and bone area. In addition, the trunk ROI had the highest reproducibility errors for fat tissue (20.7%) and lean tissue (6.2%) when compared to the other ROI.

In this review, the indications and techniques for DXA in small-sized animals (rodents, cats, and rabbits) and large-sized animals (dogs, swine, nonhuman primates, sheep, and horses) are discussed. Now that software has been developed for measuring BMD in small laboratory animals, the most frequent use of DXA in animals is in rats. An ultrahigh-resolution mode of acquisition is used for their small bones but also is necessary for other small-sized animals such as rabbits and cats. In larger-sized animals such as dogs, pigs, and sheep, software used in humans has been adapted successfully to measure BMC/BMD and body composition. The human spine and left and right hip protocols are adapted easily to animals of this size, and the software for body composition has been adapted to dogs. Measurement of bone mass around metallic implants is possible in animals and most studies have involved dogs. To ensure precision of DXA in the noninvasive measurement of BMD in animals, attention to positioning and ability of the operator to define the same region of interest using clearly defined anatomical landmarks on the scan image cannot be overemphasized. This is one of the essential requirements for successful densitometry in animals.",ovid

METHODS: One hundred thirty-eight pediatric liver transplant outpatients, who had visited the nutrition clinic in Shanghai Children's Medical Center between January 2017 and December 2019, were recruited. The bone mineral density (BMD) z-scores were determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Nutritional assessment was performed, and their corresponding height-for-age z-scores (HAZs)/weight-for-age z-scores (WAZs)/BMI-for-age z-scores (BMIZs) were obtained., RESULTS: A total of 138 patients came to our nutrition outpatient clinic, including 68 boys (49.3%) and 70 girls (50.7%). The median age was 0.87y (0.68y, 1.71y). Among these patients, 44 (31.9%) had acute malnutrition with WAZ/BMIZ value -1.14 (-2.38, -0.18), 55 (38.4%) had chronic malnutrition with HAZ value -1.51 (-2.39, -0.38), and 96 (69.6%) had a BMD lower than normal. The BMD z-score was significantly correlated with the WAZ/BMIZ value (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.334, p < 0.001). A total of 37 infants re-visited the nutrition clinic for a follow-up after (147 +/- 127) days. The WAZ/BMIZ value of the re-visiting patients and the BMD z-score of the re-visiting patients were significantly improved compared to those of the first-visit patients (p = 0.004 and p = 0.001 respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: There were different rates of malnutrition before and after liver transplantation. At the same time, BMD Z-score and serum vitamin D level of patients decreased. There was a significant correlation between BMD z-scores and WAZ/BMIZ values.

We have compared BMD results from a commercial Quantitative CT (QCT) BMD analysis system, ""CTXA Hip"", which provides clinical data for the proximal femur, to results from DXA. We have also used CTXA Hip to determine cortical and trabecular contributions to total BMD. Sixty-nine patients were scanned using 3D QCT and DXA. CTXA Hip BMD measurements for Total Hip and Femoral Neck were compared to DXA results. Twenty-two women were scanned at 0, 1, 2 years and CTXA Hip and DXA results analyzed for long-term reproducibility. Long-term reproducibility calculated as root-mean-square averages of SDs in vivo was 0.012 g/cm2 (CV = 1.8%) for CTXA Total Hip and 0.011 g/cm2 (CV = 2.0%) for CTXA Femoral Neck compared to 0.014 g/cm2 (CV = 2.0%) and 0.016 g/cm2 (CV = 2.7%), respectively, for DXA.

The present study was performed to compare bone mineral density (BMD) results in the lumbar spine of thalassemic patients measured by both dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and to determine their correlations with the markers of bone turnover. BMD was measured in the lumbar spine of 13 regularly transfused patients with beta-thalassemia major by both DEXA and QCT. Blood and urine samples were obtained for the determination of biochemical and hormonal profiles. Both T-scores and Z-scores were higher when measured by QCT (T-score = -0.41 +/- 1.31, Z-score = -0.56 +/- 1.08, mean +/- SD) compared with the values given by DEXA (T-score = -2.57 +/- 0.88, Z-score = -2.32 +/- 1.11, P = 0.0005). In comparison to DEXA, QCT T-scores were more closely correlated with age (r = -0.19 vs. r = -0.70, P = 0.0068). Strong negative correlation was found between QCT values and age (r = -0.67, P = 0.01).

DEXA T-scores were better correlated only with urine C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen, but again without statistical significance.

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of two imaging modalities in identifying bone mineral status in individuals with pre-dialysis chronic renal disease and to assess their correlation with bone turnover markers. Materials and Methods: This controlled cross-sectional study, conducted at a single center from 2019 to 2022, assessed two groups of individuals aged 18 to 50. The patient cohort consisted of individuals with stage 4-5 chronic kidney disease, whereas the control cohort consisted of healthy participants. The participants' bone and mineral status was evaluated using both QCT and DXA methods. Diagnostic measurements of the lumbar spine and femoral neck, obtained using DXA and QCT, were compared. Z-scores were utilized to evaluate low bone mineral density, with low Z-scores identified in either lumbar spine or femoral neck measures being seen as indicative of low bone mineral density. Results: Data from 38 participants (patient group: 18; control group: 20) who underwent QCT and/or DXA were evaluated. Thirty-three subjects were assessed using both QCT and DXA (patient group: 14; control group: 19). The median age of the patient cohort was 44 (range: 22-50), whereas the median age of the control cohort was 42 (range: 27-48) (p = 0.72). Women constituted 33% of the patient cohort and 50% of the control cohort (p = 0.23). In the patient cohort, low bone mineral density was detected in four individuals (28%) through QCT, and in just two patients (14%) through DXA. Compared to DXA, QCT identified a higher number of cases of low bone mineral density in the CKD cohort; however, no statistically significant difference was observed (p = 0.06). In addition, our study found that TRACP5b had a strong negative correlation with the DXA L1-L4 Z-score.

The criteria recommended by the American College of Radiology and the World Health Organization were used for lumbar osteoporosis diagnosis. The osteoporosis detection rates between QCT and DXA were compared. QCT-vBMD was plotted against the DXA T score, and the line of best fit was calculated based on linear regression. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the associations between risk factors and VF. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed, and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC) was calculated., RESULTS: QCT screening showed that 60.7% of patients had osteoporosis, whereas DXA screening showed that 50.7% of patients had osteoporosis. Diagnoses were concordant for 325 (64.9%) patients. In all, 205 patients suffered a VF of at least one anatomic level. Of these, 84.4% (173/205) were diagnosed with osteoporosis by QCT, while only 73.2% (150/205) were diagnosed by DXA. Multivariate logistic regression showed that osteoporosis detected by QCT exhibited a stronger relationship with VF than that detected by DXA (unadjusted OR, 6.81 vs. 5.04; adjusted OR, 3.44 vs. 2.66). For discrimination between patients with and without VF, QCT-vBMD (AUC = 0.802) showed better performance than DXA T score (AUC = 0.76)., CONCLUSION: In older patients undergoing spinal surgery, QCT-vBMD is more helpful than DXA in terms of osteoporosis detection rate and prediction of patients with prevalent VFs.

We assessed bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck and intertrochanteric of left hip and lumbar spine (L1-L4) sites with DXA and QUS parameters of the right and left calcanei in a cohort of 82 patients over the age of 50 years. Using DXA parameters as the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, the correlation coefficient between BMD and QUS parameters was calculated. Receiver operating characteristic curve was generated and areas under the curves were evaluated. Cut-off values for QUS were defined. In men, there was a moderate correlation between calcaneal QUS and proximal femoral BMD (P < .05), but no significant correlation between calcaneal QUS and lumbar BMD (P > .05). In women, calcaneal QUS were moderately correlated with lumbar spine and proximal femoral BMD (P < .05). Using DXA as the gold standard, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of calcaneal QUS in the diagnosis of osteoporosis were 90.2%, 89.2%, 100%, 100%, and 50.0%, respectively. According to the receiver operating characteristic curve, when the QUS T-score of calcaneum was -1.8, the area under the curve was 0.888, the sensitivity was 73.21%, and the specificity was 92.31% (P < .05). When the QUS T-score of calcaneum was -2.35, the sensitivity was 37.2% and the specificity was 100%.Calcaneal QUS can be used to predict proximal femoral BMD in middle-aged and elderly people, as well as lumbar BMD in women. As a screening method for osteoporosis, calcaneal QUS has good specificity, so it can be recommended to use it as a pre-screening tool to reduce the number of DXA screening. When the QUS T-score of calcaneum is -1.8, it has the greatest diagnostic efficiency for osteoporosis; when the QUS T-score of calcaneum is <=-2.35, it can be diagnosed as osteoporosis.

Subjects completed a postal questionnaire which included questions concerning lifestyle and were invited to undergo quantitative ultrasound (QUS) of the calcaneus and to provide a fasting blood sample from which the bone markers serum N-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1NP) and crosslinks (beta C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide (beta-cTX)), total testosterone, total oestradiol (E(2)), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) were measured. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the hip and lumbar spine was performed in two centres., RESULTS: A total of 3120, mean age 59.9 years (s.d.=11.0) were included. After adjustment for centre, age, height, weight, lifestyle factors, season and other hormones, total and free E(2) were negatively associated with beta-cTX but not P1NP while SHBG, IGF1 and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were positively associated with both beta-cTX and P1NP. Total or free testosterone was not independently associated with either bone marker. After the same adjustments, higher levels of both bone markers were significantly associated with lower QUS parameters and lower DXA-assessed bone density at the total hip and lumbar spine., CONCLUSIONS: E(2), SHBG, IGF1 and PTH contribute significantly to the regulation/rate of bone turnover in middle-aged and older European men.

We aimed in this study to assess the probable correlation of speed of sound (SOS) values obtained by QUS with bone mineral density (BMD) as measured by the gold standard method, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), and to investigate the diagnostic value of QUS to define low BMD., MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-two postmenopausal women having prior standard DEXA measurements were included in the study. Spine and proximal femur (neck, trochanter and Ward's triangle) BMD were assessed in a standard protocol by DEXA. The middle point of the right tibia was chosen for SOS measurement by tibial QUS., RESULTS: The SOS values were observed to be significantly higher in the normal BMD (t score > -1) group at all measurement sites except for the lumbar region, when compared with the low BMD group (t score < -1). SOS was negatively correlated with age (r= -0.66) and month since menopause (r= -0.57). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for QUS t score to diagnose low BMD did not seem to be satisfactory at either of the measurement sites., CONCLUSION: Tibial SOS was correlated weakly with BMD values of femur and lumbar spine as measured by DEXA and its diagnostic value did not seem to be high for discriminating between normal and low BMD, at these sites.",ovid

The Omron BF body fat monitor estimated that BF% was lower than that of the criterion method DEXA. The difference between DEXA and Omron BF 300 (III) was higher (1.1 +/- 3.0%; P = 0.04) and that between DEXA and Omron BF 306 lower (0.2 +/- 3.0%; P>0.05). Omron BF 300 (I) and (II) (series 8) had intermediate difference (0.9 +/- 3.0 and 0.9 +/- 3.0; P>0.05) when compared with DEXA. Three anthropometric equations estimated a higher BF% than cthat of DEXA. The Durnin & Womersley SKF equation BF% (1.0 +/- 2.4; P = 0.03) was higher than that of the DEXA. Deurenberg et al. and Gallagher et al. BMI-based equations overestimation yielded 0.9 +/- 3.7 and 0.6 +/- 3.8 BF% (P>0.05). From the anthropometric equations, only the Deurenberg et al. SKF equation slightly underestimated 0.5 +/- 3.4 BF% (P>0.05). DEXA-assessed BF% had highest correlation with SKF equations (r = 0.93), less so with BIA (r = 0.88-0.89) and lowest with BMI equation-assessed BF% (r = 0.81-0.84). All values were significant at P<0.001. We can conclude that the Omron BF 306 body fat monitor and the anthropometric Deurenberg et al. SKF equation yielded results close to the DEXA BF%.",ovid

To assess the applicability of tibial quantitative ultrasound measurements (QUS) in children, we performed a study that compared dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the lumbar spine and whole body with tibial QUS., METHODS: For this study we recruited 146 Dutch children and adolescents, 58 boys (median age, 14.1 years; range, 7.6-23.4 years) and 88 girls (median age, 18.0 years; range, 7.6-23.5 years). Tanner stage, weight, and height were assessed for all participants. Bone mineral density (BMD; g x cm(-2)) of the whole body and lumbar spine (L2-L4) and bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) of the lumbar spine (g x cm(-3)) were assessed by using the Lunar DPXL. For tibial QUS, the Soundscan compact system was used., RESULTS: Both lumbar as well as whole-body BMD showed a strong, significant correlation with tibial QUS in boys and girls: rtotal body boys = 0.81, rtotal body girls = 0.77, rlumbar spine boys = 0.79, and rlumbar spine girls = 0.72.

To this end, this cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the relationship between site-specific muscle size and MetS risk factors. Subjects were 38 obese men and women aged 40-82 years. Total body fat and lean body mass were assessed by whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. Muscle thickness (MTH) was measured using B-mode ultrasound scanning in six body regions. Subjects were classified into general obesity (GO) and sarcopenic obesity (SO) groups using the threshold values of one standard deviation below the sex-specific means of either MTH or skeletal muscle index (SMI) measured by DXA. MetS risk score was acquired by standardizing and summing the following continuously distributed variables: visceral fat area, mean blood pressure, HbA1c, and serum triglyceride / high density lipoprotein cholesterol, to obtain the Z-score. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the MetS risk score was independently associated with abdominal MTH in all subjects, but not with MTH in other muscle regions, including the thigh. Although HbA1c and the number of MetS risk factors in the SO group were significantly higher than those in the GO group, there were no significant differences between GO and SO groups as defined by SMI. Ultrasound-derived abdominal MTH would allow a better assessment of sarcopenia in obese patients and can be used as an alternative to the conventionally-used SMI measured by DXA.",ovid

A total of 63 postmenopausal women were enrolled. QUS envelope statistics imaging was performed on the L3 vertebra, analyzing parameters including the Nakagami parameter (m), scatterer clustering parameter (?), coherent to diffuse signal ratio (k), and entropy (H) for comparisons with DXA. The data were divided into three tertiles: reference, early VF risk, and high-risk groups. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to evaluate the predictive abilities of each parameter for VF risk. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland-Altman plots were utilized to evaluate consistency both within subjects and across different operators. There were no significant differences in QUS parameters between subjects with and without VFs overall (p > 0.05).

In recent years, athletic programs have begun employing this equipment during athlete screening. However, it is currently unknown how athletic programs are utilizing this information to guide an athlete's training and health., OBJECTIVE: To explore the literature to identify what is known regarding sports performance and athlete health based on body composition recordings., DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched for this brief review., STUDY SELECTION: A focus was placed on articles within the past 10 years that discussed DXA protocols within athletic populations; 14 articles were included in this brief literature review., STUDY DESIGN: Brief literature review., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 5., DATA EXTRACTION: One member of the research team searched the literature and retrieved articles with the purpose of analyzing and/or explaining DXA imaging in body composition analysis of active persons (primarily athletes)., RESULTS: Quality assurance scans with a phantom calibration block as well as athlete prescreening condition and activity standardization was routinely recommended. However, only 1 study reported a specific DXA protocol for athletes, and only 1 study described guidelines for how to report DXA results in athletic populations, suggesting it is plausible yet difficult due to the small changes detectable., CONCLUSION: Due to the limited literature as well as a lack of reference values for specific athletic populations, the authors of this review recommend using the current Nana et al (Int J Sport Nutr Exerc Metab 2015;25:198-215) DXA protocol for performing DXA scans in the athletic population as well as current Hind et al (J Clin Densitom 2018;21:429-443) guidelines for distributing the information.",ovid

Only papers reporting either Pearson's correlation coefficient or Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between skeletal and jawbone mineral density in more than five osteoporotic subjects were selected., RESULTS: From 1763 citations, 64 full-text papers were screened and five papers that met the inclusion criteria were included in the final analysis. None of the included studies complied with all NOS criteria, and as only two studies were eligible for meta-analysis, this was not performed., CONCLUSIONS: Only limited conclusions can be drawn from this systematic review, due to the small number of studies included, their heterogeneity, and their high risk of bias. Future studies that take into consideration both upper and lower jaws, that use the same technique to measure skeletal and jaw BMD (ideally dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, DXA), and that account for confounding variables (such as medications/diseases affecting bone metabolism and demographics) are needed to provide more robust conclusions.

Unlike postmenopausal osteoporosis, it often stems from inadequate peak bone mass accrual or secondary causes such as systemic diseases, medications, or lifestyle factors. This review explores contemporary approaches to defining, diagnosing, and treating low bone mass and osteoporosis in premenopausal women., RECENT FINDINGS: Prevalence varies according to ethnicity and is further influenced by the diagnostic criteria, with higher risks in Caucasian and Asian women. Key determinants of peak bone mass achieved by the late 20 s include genetics (60-80% of variability), nutrition (calcium, vitamin D, and protein), lifestyle (exercise, smoking, and alcohol), and occupational exposures (e.g., heavy metals and sedentary work). Pregnancy and lactation-associated osteoporosis also cause transient bone loss, particularly in high-risk individuals. Bone mineral density by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is the gold standard for diagnosis despite of certain limitations. Additionally, emerging technologies like radiofrequency echographic multi spectrometry show promise. Management focuses on optimizing bone health through adequate nutrition, weight-bearing exercises, and addressing secondary causes, when present like rheumatoid arthritis, long-term glucocorticoid use, hypogonadism, etc. Pharmacological options such as bisphosphonates and teriparatide can be considered in high-risk cases, but evidence on their safety and efficacy in premenopausal women is limited, and concerns about teratogenicity remain., SUMMARY: Early identification and intervention are critical to reduce fracture risk, emphasizing the need for better diagnostic tools and individualized treatment strategies.

JOUR,body composition by dxa: tried and true?,review,,"['Kohrt, W M']",1995,"Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is unquestionably the method of choice for the assessment of bone mass. Recent generations of DXA instruments also have the capability of assessing soft tissue mass, thereby providing a three-compartment model of body composition, i.e., bone mineral, fat, and bone-free lean masses. Although hydrodensitometry has long been considered the reference method of assessing body composition, assumptions regarding the constancy of the constituents of fat-free mass may compromise its validity in some populations. Because DXA appears to be less dependent on assumptions regarding biological consistency, it is possible that it has the potential to provide a more accurate assessment of body composition across populations than does hydrodensitometry, and that it should be considered the reference method. DXA has been shown to provide precise measures of body composition, but it remains questionable as to whether those measures are accurate. Contributing to the uncertainty regarding validity is the variability among manufacturers of DXA instruments in the methods of calibration, data acquisition, and data analysis. Although DXA holds great promise in becoming the criterion method of assessing body composition, and has been promoted as such by some investigators, available data indicate that this endorsement is premature.",ovid

JOUR,clinical review: clinical applications of vertebral fracture assessment by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry,review,10.1210/jc.2006-1178,"['Lewiecki, E Michael', 'Laster, Andrew J']",2006,"CONTEXT: Vertebral fracture (VF) is the most common type of fragility fracture, yet most VFs are not clinically apparent. VFs are associated with a significant increase in morbidity, mortality, and risk of future fracture. Many patients with VFs do not have T-scores classified as osteoporosis. Knowledge of VFs may change diagnostic classification, estimation of future fracture risk, and clinical management. VF assessment (VFA) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry is a method for imaging the spine to diagnose VFs., EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Background information and medical evidence on the technology and clinical applications of VFA was acquired by electronic searching of PubMed for appropriate terms that included vertebral fracture, imaging, diagnosis, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and cost effectiveness. Matches with the highest levels of medical evidence were selected for review, recognizing that the new and evolving nature of the field required inclusion of some material that relied partly on expert opinion., EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The sensitivity and specificity of VFA compare favorably with spine radiographs in the ability to diagnose grade 2 and 3 VFs. VFA involves less radiation, lower cost, and often greater patient convenience than spine radiography. Cost effectiveness modeling suggests that imaging of the spine in selected patients provides essential diagnostic and therapeutic information at a nominal cost. Patients with T-scores that are classified as low bone mass (osteopenia) who are selected for pharmacological therapy based on the presence of a VF benefit by reduction in fracture risk. Guidelines for the clinical application of VFA have been developed by the International Society for Clinical Densitometry., CONCLUSIONS: VFA is a technology for diagnosing VFs that may alter diagnostic classification, improve fracture risk stratification, and identify patients likely to benefit from pharmacological therapy who otherwise might not be treated.",ovid

Though alternative imaging modalities like quantitative ultrasound (QUS), radiographic absorptiometry (RA), quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and radiofrequency echographic multispectrometry (REMS) have emerged as viable diagnostic or screening tools, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is still the gold standard for measuring bone mineral density (BMD). The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the clinical usefulness, diagnostic accuracy, and dependability of different radiographic modalities for osteoporosis detection. In order to find papers published between 2001 and 2023 comparing DEXA with other radiographic modalities for osteoporosis diagnosis, a thorough search of the PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases was undertaken. There were ten studies that qualified. Study design, demographic characteristics, imaging methods, diagnostic thresholds, and performance metrics (sensitivity, specificity, and correlation coefficients) were among the data that were extracted. Across studies, DEXA consistently demonstrated high precision and strong correlation with fracture risk, confirming its role as the reference standard. QUS showed moderate agreement with DEXA, supporting its use as a screening tool but not for diagnostic confirmation. RA provided good reproducibility but lower sensitivity compared with DEXA. QCT exhibited superior sensitivity (up to 91%) and early trabecular bone detection but was limited by higher cost and radiation exposure. Emerging evidence for REMS demonstrated strong correlation with DEXA (r?=?0.85–0.90), comparable diagnostic accuracy, and the advantage of being radiation-free and portable. DEXA remains the gold standard for osteoporosis diagnosis; however, QCT and REMS show promising diagnostic accuracy and may complement DEXA for early detection and longitudinal monitoring. QUS and RA can serve as cost-effective screening tools, particularly in settings where DEXA is unavailable. Further large-scale, prospective studies with standardized diagnostic thresholds are needed to validate these findings an",Scie

The constant development of DXA technique is due to the aging of societies and the increasing importance of osteoporosis as a public health problem. In order to assess the degree of bone demineralization in patients with hyperparathyroidism, forearm DXA examination is recommended. The vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) of the thoracic and lumbar spine, performed by a highly-skilled technician, is an interesting alternative to the X-ray examination. The DXA total body examination can be useful in the evaluation of fat redistribution among patients after bariatric surgery, in patients infected with HIV and receiving antiretroviral therapy, and in patients with metabolic diseases and suspected to have sarcopenia. The assessment of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and detection of abdominal aortic calcifications may be useful in the prediction of cardiovascular events. The positive effect of anti-resorptive therapy may affect some parameters of DXA hip structure analysis (HSA). Long-term anti-resorptive therapy, especially with the use of bisphosphonates, may result in changes in the DXA image, which may herald atypical femur fractures (AFF). Reduction of the periprosthetic BMD in the DXA measurements can be used to estimate the likelihood of loosening the prosthesis and periprosthetic fractures.

We developed a method for deriving structural geometry of the femur from the proximal shaft through the femoral neck, using data from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. The geometric properties are employed in a two-dimensional curved beam model of the proximal femur to estimate stresses on the lateral and medial bone surfaces. Stresses calculated by this method are compared with those from the conventional flexure formula and with results produced from a cadaver femur with use of three-dimensional finite element analysis of computed tomography data. Loading conditions simulating a one-legged stance and a fall on the greater trochanter are employed. Stresses calculated by curved beam theory are in much better agreement with three-dimensional finite element analysis than are those for which the conventional straight beam formula was used. In simulation of a fall on the greater trochanter, all three methods show peaks of stress at the femoral neck but only the curved beam and finite element analysis methods show an additional peak at the medial intertrochanteric margin. Both neck and trochanter regions correspond to common failure sites for hip fractures in the elderly. The curved beam treatment of hip structure derived from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry provides an approach for the in vivo engineering analysis of hip structure that is not practical by other methods.",ovid

It is complex because it is highly dependent on many factors, such as image acquisition, processing, analysis, and subsequent examination interpretation. Each step is subject to potential errors, artifacts, and diagnostic pitfalls; hence, meticulous attention must be paid to the technique by both the technologist and the interpreting physician to provide high-quality results and, in turn, maximize the examination's clinical utility.

Positional analysis of body composition using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I football and men's lacrosse. J Strength Cond Res 36(6): 1699-1707, 2022-Despite the widespread use of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), few studies have examined differences in body composition between positions within sports and none have reported DXA-derived body composition reference values for men's lacrosse. The purpose of this study was to examine differences in measures of total and regional body composition and bone mineral density (BMD) using DXA across sport positions in a large cohort of National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I male lacrosse and football players. A total of 294 male athletes (football, n = 196; lacrosse, n = 98) underwent DXA. One-way analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to examine whether body composition variables differed by sports position. In football, position was a significant determinant for every compositional variable in football athletes (all, p < 0.05; effect size range = 0.24-0.79). Offensive linemen had the highest total body fat percentage (30.1 +/- 2.9%), followed by fullbacks (26.7 +/- 3.3%) and defensive linemen (24.6 +/- 5.7%); wide receivers had the lowest (14.5 +/- 2.1%). For total body BMD, defensive linemen had the highest (1.70 +/- 0.09 g.cm-3), followed by linebackers (1.67 +/- 0.09 g.cm-3) and offensive linemen (1.65 +/- 0.09 g.cm-3); kickers had the lowest (1.45 +/- 0.11 g.cm-3) BMD. In lacrosse, no differences were found between positions for any total or regional body composition and BMD measure (all, p > 0.05). Our data confirm that total and regional measures of body composition and BMD vary across positions in football but not in men's lacrosse. Unlike football, similarities in body composition among lacrosse players may indicate that the uniformity of training demands or preferred player attributes in team selection outweigh the unique positional demands in gameplay.

However, DXA has been subjected to recurring claims that it is overutilized, too expensive, and not helpful in patient management. In recent years, there has been a decline in the number of office-based DXA facilities, a reduction in BMD tests performed, and fewer women being diagnosed and treated for osteoporosis, despite aging of the population with more people at risk for fractures.

The presence of T2DM was associated with 2-fold higher odds of low FFM (OR 2.38 [1.44 to 3.95]). We found evidence that greater VFM is a risk factor for prevalent and incident T2DM. While the presence of T2DM is associated with reduced FFM; the relationship between FFM and BFM with T2DM remains unclear. Reducing VFM and increasing FFM through lifestyle changes may reduce the risk of T2DM and mitigate its deleterious effect on BC, respectively.",ovid

Methods The Belgian Bone Club (BBC) gathered a guideline developer group. Nine “Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome” (PICO) questions covering screening, diagnosis, non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments, and monitoring were formulated. A systematic search of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus was performed to find network meta-analyses, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, guidelines, and recommendations from scientific societies published in the last 10 years. Manual searches were also performed. Summaries of evidence were provided, and recommendations were further validated by the BBC board members and other national scientific societies’ experts. Results Of the 3840 references in the search, 333 full texts were assessed for eligibility, and 129 met the inclusion criteria. Osteoporosis screening using clinical risk factors should be considered. Patients with a recent (<2 years) major osteoporotic fracture were considered at very high and imminent risk of future fracture. The combination of bone mineral density measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and 10-year fracture risk was used to categorize patients as low or high risk. Patient education, the combination of weight-bearing and resistance training, and optimal calcium intake and vitamin D status were recommended. Antiresorptive and anabolic osteoporosis treatment should be considered for patients at high and very high fracture risk, respectively. Follow-up should focus on compliance, and patient-tailored monitoring should be considered. Conclusion BBC guidelines and 25 guideline recommendations bridge the gap between research and clinical practice for the screening, diagnosis, and management of osteoporosis.",Scie

Participants were instructed to adhere to the following pretest protocol: refrain from food and drink 12 h prior to testing and wear tight fitting clothing. Body composition (BCA) was assessed using US, DXA and ADP in accordance with the respective manufacturer's guidelines. Two-way mixed-model AVOVA and Bland and Altman techniques were applied to explore agreement for FM and FFM among the three methods: US, ADP and DXA and by sex., RESULTS: There was no statistically significant effect by sex for either FM or FFM across all BCA comparisons (P = 0.504 and 0.510, respectively). US was not statistically different from ADP for FM and FFM (P = 1.00). However, for FM and FFM, there were significant differences between DXA and both US and ADP (P<=0.001). The Bland and Altman analyses revealed large individual differences for all BCA., CONCLUSION: There was statistical agreement between US and ADP for FM and FFM but lack of agreement for US and ADP when compared to DXA. However, the large limits of agreement between methods warrant caution in generalizing these findings. Copyright © 2016 Scandinavian Society of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine.

JOUR,a comparison of quantitative ultrasound of the calcaneus with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in hospitalized orthopaedic trauma patients,to read,10.1097/BOT.0b013e3181b8b036,"['Collinge, Cory A', 'Lebus, George', 'Gardner, Michael J', 'Gehrig, Laura']",2010,"OBJECTIVES: Osteoporosis remains underdiagnosed in orthopaedic trauma patients. Recently, protocols have emerged to identify and treat osteoporosis in this population. Our purpose was to compare the usefulness of quantitative ultrasound of calcaneus (QUS) with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for identifying orthopaedic trauma patients at risk for osteoporotic fractures., DESIGN: A retrospective review of an osteoporosis screening protocol comparing QUS and DXA., SETTING: Regional trauma center., PATIENTS: Three hundred sixty consecutive hospitalized orthopaedic trauma patients treated by a single surgeon., INTERVENTION: QUS T-score and DXA bone mineral density T-scores (hip or radius) were obtained relative to U.S. normative data., MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: QUS and DXA data were statistically compared to analyze their relationship. Potential thresholds for osteoporosis risk were subsequently defined., RESULTS: Testing was successfully performed with heel QUS in 350 patients and with DXA in 129 patients. One hundred twenty-six patients underwent testing with both modalities. According to World Health Organization criteria, 17% of patients tested with DXA had osteoporosis. A good predictive relationship between hip bone mineral density, as estimated by calcaneal QUS, and direct DXA measurement was seen (Pearson's r correlation coefficient of 0.53; area under the curve of 0.84 with 95% confidence interval=0.75-0.90; P=0.0001). QUS T-score cutoffs of greater than -0.9 resulted in 90% sensitivity (defining low osteoporosis risk) and a threshold of -1.6 or less resulted in a specificity of 80% (defining high osteoporosis risk)., CONCLUSIONS: Substantial logistical difficulties are inherent in attempting to obtain DXA scans in orthopaedic trauma patients at our regional trauma center. For those patients who did undergo DXA, a strong predictive relationship was seen between hip bone mineral density and QUS parameters. QUS thresholds in defining low- and high-risk subjects for osteoporosis in this population using this device are proposed. QUS is a simple, reliable, and relatively inexpensive tool for evaluating osteoporosis risk in orthopaedic trauma patients.",ovid

However, the effect of prior acute exercise is unexamined. This study examined the impact of an acute endurance exercise and resistance exercise session on standardised brightness-mode ultrasound measurements of subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness compared to skinfolds and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry body composition estimates. In a randomised cross-over design, 30 active adults (24.2 +/- 4.9 years) undertook physique assessment via standardised brightness-mode ultrasound, skinfolds and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry before, immediately and 45 min after an acute endurance or resistance exercise session. The mean sum of eight subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness measured via standardised brightness-mode ultrasound increased (0.6 mm, p = 0.04) immediately postendurance exercise but was not meaningful when evaluated against the technical error of measurement of the investigator. A significant (p = 0.01) but not meaningful decrease in the sum of eight skinfolds occurred immediately (-1.1 +/- 0.4 mm) and 45 min (-1.3 +/- 0.4 mm) postresistance exercise. Comparatively, endurance exercise elicited a meaningful decrease of total mass (460 +/- 30 g) and trunk lean mass (680 +/- 90 g) dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry estimates. Findings from this study indicate standardised client presentation may be unnecessary when employing either standardised brightness-mode ultrasound or skinfolds for body composition assessment unlike dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.

We aim to study the association between low-frequency (LF) axial transmission ultrasound and hip fracture risk in a population-based sample of older women., METHODS: The study population consisted of 490 community-dwelling women (78-82 years). Ultrasound velocity (V(LF)) at mid-tibia was measured in 2006 using a low-frequency scanning axial transmission device. Bone mineral density (BMD) at proximal femur measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used as the reference method. The fracture history of the participants was collected from December 1997 until the end of 2010. Lifestyle-related risk factors and mobility were assessed at 1997., RESULTS: During the total follow-up period (1997-2010), 130 women had one or more fractures, and 20 of them had a hip fracture. Low V(LF) (the lowest quartile) was associated with increased hip fracture risk when compared with V(LF) in the normal range (Odds ratio, OR = 3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-8.4). However, V(LF) was not related to fracture risk when all bone sites were considered. Osteoporotic femoral neck BMD was associated with higher risk of a hip fracture (OR = 4.1, 95% CI 1.6-10.5) and higher risk of any fracture (OR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.6-3.8) compared to the non-osteoporotic femoral neck BMD. Decreased VLF remained a significant risk factor for hip fracture when combined with lifestyle-related risk factors (OR = 3.3, 95% CI 1.2-9.0)., CONCLUSION: Low V(LF) was associated with hip fracture risk in older women even when combined with lifestyle-related risk factors.

The purpose of the present study was to compare two bedside methods for the measurement of body composition using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) as a reference method. Fat-free mass (FFM) was measured using DEXA, bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) and skinfold anthropometry (SFA) in a cohort of 85 COPD patients accepted for pulmonary rehabilitation. Patients whose body mass index was >30 were excluded. Relative to DEXA, BIA underestimated FFM, whereas it was overestimated by SFA. There was a systematic increase in bias with mean FFM for both DEXA versus BIA and DEXA versus SFA, but this was almost eliminated when results were expressed as FFM index. Significant sex differences in the bias of BIA and SFA measurements of FFM were found. Forty-two (49.4%) patients were identified as nutritionally depleted using DEXA. Compared to DEXA, the sensitivity for detecting nutritional depletion was 86 and 74% for BIA and SFA, respectively, and the specificity 88 and 98%, respectively.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic potential of QUS of calcaneum and to correlate it with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) in chronic haemodialysis patients., METHODS: Broad-band ultrasound attenuation (BUA; dB/MHz) and speed of sound (SOS; m/s) of calcaneum and DEXA (g/cm(2)) measurements of the lumbar spine and hip were made in 39 patients. The indices obtained by either method were compared with age-and sex-matched controls. Calcaneal measurements were correlated to DEXA and relevant clinical and biochemical data of patients., RESULTS: BUA and SOS values were markedly reduced in dialysis patients compared to controls (59.1+/-13.8 vs 73.0+/-16.2 dB/MHz, P:<0.001 and 1533+/-28 vs 1560+/-29 m/s, P:=0.014 respectively).

Mean (SD) age was 62 (13) years, mean disease duration 15 years. Most were or had been receiving glucocorticoid treatment. Calcaneal bone quality expressed as speed of sound (SOS, m/s), broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA, dB/MHz), and stiffness was measured by QUS. BMD of the femoral neck, spine, and distal forearm was measured by dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA). Maximal voluntary isokinetic quadriceps strength (Nm) was assessed by isokinetic dynamometry. Pain was recorded on a visual analogue scale (VAS), disability was scored by the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and the degree of physical impairment was expressed by the Steinbrocker index (SI)., RESULTS: In multiple regression analyses, QS predicted SOS, BUA, and stiffness (r(partial) ranging from 0.36 to 0.45, p<0.005) and femoral neck BMD (r(partial)=0.30, p<0.05) independently of age, height, weight, disease duration, HAQ, VAS, SI, and cumulative steroid dose. BMD of the spine and distal forearm was not associated with QS. After adjustment for covariates, women with subnormal BMD of the femoral neck (T score <-1), had a 20% lower QS than those with normal BMD (p<0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Calcaneal bone quality and femoral neck BMD were associated with QS in women with RA.

JOUR,could radiofrequency echographic multispectrometry (rems) overcome the overestimation in bmd by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) at the lumbar spine?,to read,10.1186/s12891-022-05430-6,"['Caffarelli, Carla', 'Tomai Pitinca, Maria Dea', 'Al Refaie, Antonella', 'De Vita, Michela', 'Catapano, Simone', 'Gonnelli, Stefano']",2022,"BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) and vertebral fractures at the lumbar spine lead to an overestimation of bone mineral density (BMD). Recently, a new approach for osteoporosis diagnosis, defined as radiofrequency echographic multi-spectrometry (REMS), represents an innovative diagnostic tool that seems to be able to investigate bone quality and provide an estimation of fracture risk independent of BMD. The aim of this paper was to evaluate whether the use of REMS technology can favor the diagnosis of osteoporosis in subjects with an apparent increase in BMD., METHODS: In a cohort of 159 postmenopausal (66.2 +/- 11.6 yrs) women with overestimated BMD by DXA at the lumbar spine, we performed an echographic scan with the REMS technique., RESULTS: The mean values of BMD at different skeletal sites obtained by the DXA and REMS techniques showed that the BMD T-scores by REMS were significantly lower than those obtained by the DXA technique both at the lumbar spine (p < 0.01) and at all femoral subregions (p < 0.05). In OA subjects, the percentage of women classified as ""osteoporotic"" on the basis of BMD by REMS was markedly higher with respect to those classified by DXA (35.1% vs 9.3%, respectively). Similarly, the REMS allows a greater number of fractured patients to be classified as osteoporotic than DXA (58.7% vs 23.3%, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: REMS technology by the analysis of native raw unfiltered ultrasound signals appears to be able to overcome the most common artifacts, such as OA and vertebral fracture of the lumbar spine, which affect the value of BMD by DXA.

Radiofrequency echographic multi-spectrometry (REMS), a portable and radiation-free alternative, enables effective BMD evaluation in this vulnerable and underserved population. This cross-sectional study assessed BMD using REMS in 260 patients aged >= 70 years (39 males, 221 females; mean age 82.29 years) between April 2023 and July 2024. Osteoporosis diagnosis was based on T-scores < - 2.5 SD or history of fragility fractures, with severe osteoporosis defined by WHO criteria and high fracture risk by lumbar T-scores < - 3.3 SD. Care home patients had significantly lower BMD and T-scores than outpatients, with 56.3% diagnosed with severe osteoporosis and 71.8% exhibiting lumbar T-scores < - 3.3 SD. Despite high fracture risks, only 12.7% of care home patients received treatment. These trends were consistent across all age groups, revealing a high prevalence and severity of osteoporosis in care home residents. REMS has unveiled a substantial treatment gap in this population, emphasizing the critical need for improved osteoporosis management and proactive interventions to reduce fracture risks among care home patients worldwide.

Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent fractures and improve patient outcomes. This study investigates the diagnostic utility of morphometric and cortical indices derived from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) for identifying osteoporotic postmenopausal women who were candidates for dental implant therapy, with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) used as the reference standard., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 71 postmenopausal women, aged 50-79 years, who underwent CBCT imaging at the Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology Department of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences between 2022 and 2024. Participants with systemic conditions affecting bone metabolism were excluded. The morphometric indices-Computed Tomography Mandibular Index (CTMI), Computed Tomography Index Superior (CTI(S)), Computed Tomography Index Inferior (CTI(I)), and Computed Tomography Cortical Index (CTCI)-were measured at the mental foramen and antegonial regions using OnDemand3D Dental software. Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed by DXA scans of the lumbar spine and femoral neck. In addition to traditional statistical analyses (Pearson's correlation and one-way ANOVA with LSD test), a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network model was employed to evaluate the diagnostic power of CBCT indices., RESULTS: DXA results based on the femoral neck T-scores categorized 38 patients as normal, 32 as osteopenic, and one as osteoporotic, while lumbar spine T-scores identified 38 normal, 22 osteopenic, and 11 osteoporotic patients. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed in most CBCT-derived indices, with the CTMI index demonstrating the most marked variation, especially between normal and osteoporotic groups (p < 0.001). Moreover, significant positive correlations were found between the CBCT indices and DXA T-scores across the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip regions. The neural network model achieved an overall diagnostic accuracy of 75%, with the highest predictive importance",ovid

Diagnostic tools such as Bindex R (a novel ultrasound-based diagnostic technology) and DXA (X-ray-based) play a key role in identifying and assessing bone conditions. This study aimed to evaluate and compare these two approaches' overall acceptability, comfort, and preference. Feelings of pain and perceptions regarding the scan length during the Bindex R scanning procedure were also assessed., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two diagnostic imaging tools were used in this comparative study: Bindex R (pulse-echo ultrasound technology) and DXA (X-ray technology). A bespoke questionnaire was employed to gather the participants' responses, which were coded numerically, and data were analysed statistically., RESULTS: Despite minor discomfort associated with the gel application, Bindex R received significantly higher acceptability and comfort ratings than DXA, with many participants preferring its non-ionising radiation. Both methods were generally well-received, though some favoured DXA for not requiring gel., CONCLUSION: In addition to enhancing diagnostic workflows, we demonstrated that Bindex R scans can improve patient satisfaction. This study emphasised the importance of innovating medical imaging diagnostic tools to prioritise patient acceptability and comfort.

Objectives The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the REMS BMD assessment with dual-energy X-rays absorptiometry (DXA) in a cohort of patients affected by end-stage renal disease undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Methods Consecutive patients referring to the PD clinic of our hospital were enrolled. Lumbar spine and proximal femur REMS scans were performed, and lumbar spine (anteroposterior and laterolateral) and proximal femur DXA scans were performed as well. Clinical data were extracted from medical records. The risk assessment outputs of two fracture risk algorithms (FRAXÂ® and DeFRAÂ®), calculated upon the worst BMD obtained from either technique were compared as well. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc analysis (Bonferroni) and a two-sided Student's t-test were used to estimate the absolute differences between groups. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants included (protocol 1483 CESC). Results 41 total patients were enrolled (table 1). No significant differences were documented between the BMD T-scores measured through DXA or REMS at the proximal femur. At the lumbar spine, the DXA laterolateral T-score was not significantly different from that of REMS, while the DXA anteroposterior T-score was significantly higher than both the anteroposterior DXA and the REMS measurements (figure 1). When either DXA or REMS was adopted, no significant difference in the fracture risk estimate was found for both algorithms (figure 2). Conclusions Our data showed a good agreement, in a real-life PD setting, between the DXA and REMS-derived BMDs and in the consequent fracture risk assessment obtained with the FRAXÂ® or DeFRAÂ® tools.",Scie

However, the use of REMS for bone densitometry in patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities (SMID) remains to be reported. This study aimed to investigate whether REMS technology can be used for densitometric evaluation of osteoporosis in patients with SMID with hip dislocation and severe scoliosis. Methods Sixty-five patients with SMID, who resided in a long-term care facility and received comprehensive medical and rehabilitation care, underwent REMS scans of the femoral neck and/or lumbar spine. Data regarding anthropometric parameters (height and weight), bone mineral density (BMD), clinical diagnostic classification, physical ability, presence of scoliosis and hip dislocation, and frontal radiographs of both hip joints were obtained. Results We included 29 men and 34 women (mean age: 52.6 years). All patients underwent successful scanning at either the femoral neck (82.5 %) or lumbar spine (95.2 %). BMD measurements obtained using REMS revealed low values, with a mean BMD, T-score, and Z-score of 0.67 g/cm2, ?2.39 standard deviation (SD), and ? 1.38 SD, respectively, at the femoral neck and 0.66 g/cm2, ?2.70 SD, and ? 1.87 SD, respectively, at the lumbar spine. The average Cobb angle of the lumbar spine was 34.0°; furthermore, dislocation rates did not significantly differ between those with and without successful BMD measurements (p = 0.073). Lumbar BMD T-scores were significantly correlated with femoral neck BMD T-scores (p < 0.001, r = 0.530). Conclusion All patients with SMID were able to undergo measurements of either spinal or femoral neck BMD; furthermore, 77.7 % of the patients underwent measurements at both the lumbar spine and femur. Our data suggest that REMS is useful for measuring BMD in patients with SMID who are residing in institutions.",Scie

The weight gain that is evidenced amid the transitional stage of college years increases the risks associated with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The BodyMetrix R BX-2000 (ULTRA) using a seven-site method has been evaluated against dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for estimation of body composition, which has yielded conflicting results. To date, no studies have compared the three-site method Jackson and Pollock three-site method to DXA., PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was twofold (i) to compare agreement between Jackson-Pollock seven site (JP7), Jackson-Pollock three site (JP3) and Pollock three site (P3) to predict body fat (%BF) using ULTRA and (ii) and to compare the three ULTRA methodologies against DXA., METHODS: Seventy-six healthy college-aged subjects (ages = 22.08 +/- 2.50 years) participated in this study. DXA and ULTRA body composition assessments were performed following manufacturer's instructions to estimate %BF. Paired sample t-tests were used to assess agreement between JP7, P3 and JP3. Additionally, a two-tailed sample t-test was performed by sex. ULTRA and DXA results were also performed for agreement and bivariate correlation., RESULTS: No significant differences between JP7 and P3, P = 0.38, were observed. In males, no significant differences were observed between JP7 and P3, P = 0.18. Significant differences were observed in all other pairs, P<=0.001 and between ULTRA and DXA., CONCLUSIONS: The Pollock 3-site method estimates body fat percentage with comparable accuracy to JP7 using ULTRA.
