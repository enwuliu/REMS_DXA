JOUR,AB0297?MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF RISK FACTORS FOR HIGH RADIOFREQUENCY ECHOGRAPHIC MULTISPECTROMETRY (REMS) - BASED FRAGILITY SCORE OF THE LUMBAR SPINE,"['Bischoff, E.', 'Bischoff, F.', 'Vladeva, S.', 'Kovachev, M.', 'Kinov, P.']",2024,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2024-eular.1298,"Background: A previous published prospective study using Radiofrequency echographic multispectrometry (REMS) demonstrated the fragility score (FS) of the lumbar spine as a good indicator for subjects at risk of major osteoporotic fractures (spine, hip, radius, humerus or forearm). The best cut-off value of FS = 37.2 was considered in this paper [1]. Objectives: The aim of the current study is to investigate the multivariate significant risk factors for FS? 37.2. Methods: In our study, REMS assessments of 252 women with mean age 60 years (yrs.) ± 13 yrs. (range 35-81 yrs.) were conducted. We set up two groups according to the FS of the lumbar spine of the subjects: 1st group with FS ? 37.2 and 2nd group with FS <37.2. Age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), menopausal status, history of previous fractures, diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), use of corticosteroids (CS), current smoking and alcohol consumption of three or more drinks daily were the risk factors included in the multivariate statistical analysis. We analyzed the significant risk factors for FS ? 37.2 with binary logistic regression. The data collection and transfer from the electronic health record was performed with an innovative JAVA tool, developed by Kirilov et al. [2,3]. Results: Of total 252 women the mean weight was of 65.6 kg. ± 14.1 kg. (range 41-117 kg.), mean height 158.2 cm. ± 8.5 cm. (range 132-179 cm.) and mean BMI 27.2 kg/cm2 ± 5.5 kg/cm2 (range 14.1-46.6 kg/cm2). 227 women (90.1%) were attributed to postmenopausal. Age (p<0.001), menopause (p=0.006), history of previous fractures (p<0.001), diagnosis of RA (p=0.003) and use of CS (p=0.002) were the multivariate significant risk factors for FS ? 37.2. Odds ratio (OR) for the risk factor age was 1.3, so each added year of the women’s age increased the risk for FS ? 37.2 by 1.3%. The risk factor menopause showed OR of 7.24, so postmenopausal women had about 7.2 times higher risk of FS ? 37.2 compared to women who still have their menstruation. Subjects with previous fractures had 15.3 times higher risk for FS ? 37.2 than non-fractured subjects. ORs were 2.16 for RA and 3.24 for the use of CS, so women with RA had 2.2 times higher risk (3.2 times higher if the subject is taking CS) for FS ? 37.2 than those without these risk factors. Conclusion: In the following study, we used multivariate regression to analyze which are the specific risk factors to predict high REMS-based FS of the lumbar spine. Old postmenopausal women with previous fractures, diagnosis of RA and use of CS demonstrated the highest risk of FS ? 37.2. REFERENCES: [1] Pisani, P., Conversano, F., Muratore, M. et al.

JOUR,AB0298?ASSESSMENT OF THE HIP FRAGILITY SCORE WITH RADIOFREQUENCY ECHOGRAPHIC MULTISPECTROMETRY (REMS) OF FRACTURED AND NON-FRACTURED WOMEN,"['Bischoff, F.', 'Vladeva, S.']",2024,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2024-eular.1307,"Background: Osteoporosis is associated with a higher risk of fragility fractures. The innovative method Radiofrequency echographic multispectrometry (REMS) has the opportunity to assess not only the bone quantity by analyzing the bone mineral density but also the bone quality through the evaluation of the fragility score (FS) [1]. Bone quality is closely associated with higher fracture risk. Objectives: The aim of our study is to assess the hip fragility score with REMS of fractured and non-fractured women. Methods: The FS of the hip of 65 women was assessed with REMS. Age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density (BMD), T-score, Z-score and FS were compared between the fractured and non-fractured women using independent sample T-test. Data collection and transfer from the electronic health record was performed with an innovative JAVA tool, developed by Kirilov et al. [2,3]. Results: Subjects had average age of 62 years (yr.) with range 56-81 yr. 15 women (32.1%) reported a previous fracture. Fractured subjects were significantly older (mean age of 81 yr.) than non-fractured subjects (mean age of 56 yr.), p<0.001. Height didn’t differ significantly between the both groups. Fractured women had significantly lower weight and BMI compared to non-fractured group, p<0.001. Fractured subjects had also lower hip BMD (0.518 g/cm2), lower T-score (-2.9 SD) and Z-score (-0.7 SD) of the hip and higher hip fragility score (71.1) compared to non-fractured subjects (BMD=0.742 g/cm2, T-score= -1.0 SD, Z-score=-0.3 SD and FS=25.7), p<0.001. Conclusion: Fractured women demonstrated higher fragility score than non-fractured women. These results showed the good ability of the REMS based fragility score to select subjects with deteriorated bone microarchitecture. REFERENCES: [1] Al Refaie A, Baldassini L, Mondillo C, et al.

JOUR,AB0299?COMPARING SARC-F VERSUS DEXA FOR SARCOPENIA ASSESSMENT IN PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND INTERMEDIATE/HIGH FRACTURE RISK,"['Rodriguez-Flores, A.G.', 'Bardan-Inchaustegui, A.C.', 'Carrazco-Chapa, A.', 'Rodriguez-Orozco, G.', 'Cervantes-Charles, G.J.', 'Sanchez-Fonseca, A.P.', 'Skinner-Taylor, C.M.', 'Negrete-Lopez, R.', 'Cardenas-de la Garza, J.A.', 'Galarza-Delgado, D.A.']",2024,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2024-eular.1432,"Background: Sarcopenia is defined as the loss of muscle mass and strength. It is a common condition in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because it causes a decrease in lean mass that may result in physical disability, weakness, infections, and even premature death. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is used to measure muscle mass. European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2) recommends the SARC-F, a tool that measures the risk of sarcopenia. A SARC-F study in rheumatic patients with sarcopenia detected sarcopenia risk in only 40% of the patients. Objectives: To compare the sarcopenia risk frequency by SARC-F and the sarcopenia detection by DEXA in high to intermediate fracture risk RA patient. Methods: A transversal and descriptive study included patients from our clinic in a University Hospital in Monterrey, Mexico diagnosed with RA according to ACR/EULAR criteria. The DEXA scan was used to diagnose sarcopenia based on muscle mass percentage. Sarcopenia was identified with the EWGSOP2 criteria with a muscle mass percentage of ?7.0 kg/m2 in men and ?5.5 kg/m2 in women. The SARC-F tool considers a score of >4 as a high risk of sarcopenia. Shapiro-Wilk to determine normality and T-student test for compare groups were performed. Data were presented as percent frequency, mean ± standard deviation (SD), or median and interquartile range (IQR). Spearman correlation test was performed. A p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS v.25. Results: A total of 32 patients diagnosed with RA were included, 30 (93.8%) were women and 2 (4.3%) were men. The mean age of patients was 65 ± 9.81. Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics. We found that 12 (37.5%) patients have sarcopenia with a mean muscle mass percentage of 5.92 ± 1.01. Risk of sarcopenia with SARC-F was identified in 18 (56.3%), with a mean of 4.16 ± 2.73. We compared the sarcopenia-risk patients with those who had already developed sarcopenia. There was no statistically significant difference between the two methods (p=0.147). The frequencies and p-value obtained from the chi-square test are shown in Table 2. Conclusion: There was no statistically significant difference between the SARC-F and DEXA, suggesting that both methods effectively identify sarcopenia. This suggests that the SARC-F questionnaire can be used as a valuable non-invasive and easily accessible screening tool for detecting sarcopenia risk in RA patients, and is important as we found that our patient’s risk of sarcopenia compared with that reported in the literature, however, further studies are needed to establish the methods we must plan for our high-risk patients.

JOUR,AB0304?BONE DENSITY IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS ASSESSED BY RADIOFREQUENCY ECHOGRAPHIC MULTISPECTROMETRY: HOW FREQUENT ARE OSTEOPENIA AND OSTEOPOROSIS?,"['Icatoiu, E.', 'Cobilinschi, C.', 'B?l?nescu, A.', 'Bojinca, V.']",2024,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2024-eular.4434,"Background: The frequency of osteoporosis (OP) after performing dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been reported to vary from 11 to 38.9% in the lumbar spine and from 6.3 to 36.2% in the total hip. Radiofrequency echographic multispectrometry (REMS) is an innovative non-ionizing technology that evaluates bone mineral density by analysing raw unfiltered native ultrasound signals. Its daily clinical use is still limited though and further data is required in order to sustain its accuracy. Objectives: The study aimed to explore the prevalence of reduced bone mineral density (BMD) measured with REMS technology and the potential risks for osteopenia and osteoporosis in a Romanian patients sample. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study design was carried out. For this study, forty patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis were recruited and further accepted for demographic data collection, the body mass index (BMI), disease evolution, blood and BMD tests (T score, fragility score (FS), the risk of major osteoporotic fracture in 5 years (MOF5y) for lumbar spine and femoral neck). Disease activity score at 28 joints (DAS28) and health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) were recorded. Chi-square, Pearson correlations, independent t test were calculated using IBM SPSS software. Risk factors for bone loss were analyzed by logistic regression. Results: Forty patients were included in the study: 38 females (30 post-menopausal) and 2 men, with the mean age 56.97±13.48 years, mean BMI 26.4±5.1 kg/m2 and mean disease length 11.32±10.97 years. Twenty two were undergoing corticotherapy. Eight patients (20%) had a score of osteoporosis (T score<-2.5) in at least one measured site and 22 (55%) patients had a score of osteopenia (-2.5<T score<-1), respectively. 82.5% of the subjects were taking at least one conventional syntetic disease modifying antirheumatic drug (csDMARDs) and 35% a biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs). A multiple linear regression analysis showed that the age and BMI are risk factors for BMD changes in the spine (F=65.45, p = <.001, R2 = 0.78) and the hip (F=19.08, p = <.001, R2 = 0.92.) The presence of menopause, the length of the disease, the HAQ, DAS28 or administration of csDMARDs/BDMARDs were not statistically significant in impacting the T score in any of the measured sites. Positive correlations between HAQ and hip FS (r=0.321, p=0.049) and between the length of the disease and MOF5y (r=0.507, p=0.01) were found. 78.9% of those with osteopenia scores in L1-L4 and 71.4% of those with osteoporotic score in L1-L4 had an active disease score (DAS28>2.6). Conclusion: The prevalence of osteoporosis in rheumatoid arthritis patients evaluated by REMS is similar to the available data using DXA. REMS can provide qualitative bone assessment using the FS and thus may be a useful tool for enhancing early diagnosis of osteoporosis. Low BMI and age are traditional risk factors in rheumatoid arthritis patients confirmed again as associated with higher risk of osteopenia/osteoporosis when diagnosed with REMS technology. More interventions should be given to osteopenia patients because its prevalence is higher than osteoporosis. REFERENCES: [1] Hu Z, Zhang L, Lin Z, Zhao C, Xu S, Lin H, Zhang J, Li W, Chu Y.

JOUR,AB0305?BONE HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT IN KIDNEY TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS PATIENTS (KTR) FRACTURED AND NON-FRACTURED BY MEANS DXA AND REMS TECHNOLOGIES,"['Fassio, A.', 'Adami, G.', 'Benini, C.', 'Dartizio, C.', 'Gatti, D.', 'Gatti, M.', 'Stomaci, C.', 'Contaldo, F.R.', 'Andreola, S.', 'Ferraro, P.M.', 'Gambaro, G.', 'Rossini, M.']",2024,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2024-eular.5363,"Background: The kidney plays an essential role in the regulatory system for bone and mineral metabolism. During the post renal-transplant period, a significant loss in bone strength, characterized by high rates of osteopenia and osteoporosis occurs with consequent higher susceptibility to fracture. The clinical management of bone diseases in transplant patients is complex due to both, the frequent persistence of Chronic Renal Disease (CKD) and the normal aging process, leading to a continuous need for regular bone status monitoring. Objectives: The aim of the present study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the non-ionizing method, Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS) for the detection of impaired bone status of kidney transplant recipients (KTR) fractured and non-fractured in comparison to conventional dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Methods: A cohort of 39 male and women Caucasian patients undergoing kidney transplantation was enrolled in the study. All enrolled patients underwent a lumbar spine (LS) examination both with REMS and with DXA. Because of renal impairment, KTR patients experience substantial bone loss which is associated to a reduced T-score and consequent susceptibility to fragility fractures. On the basis of the history of fragility fractures collected from each participant, the cohort was stratified into two groups, fractured and non-fractured patients, and the bone health status was evaluated using both techniques. From a total of 39 lumbar scans, 9 and 30 scans encompassed patients with and without a fracture history, respectively. Results: As expected, the fractured group yielded a lower spinal T-score values compared to the non-fractured ones with both REMS and DXA techniques (Table 1). The measurements differed significantly between the two technologies. In particular, considering the whole cohort of fractured and non-fractured patients, the mean BMD at the lumbar spine obtained with REMS was 0.866 ± 0.104 g/cm2, which was significantly lower than the corresponding DXA ones (0.929 ± 0.191 g/cm2; p<0.05). Similarly, significant differences were found on the corresponding T- and Z-score values between the two technologies (p<0.05). Moreover, in the non-fractured group, significant differences were found between the REMS-measured BMD, T- and Z-score versus DXA-measured values (all with p<0.001). Indeed, in these patients while a T-score of -1.0 ± 1.6 was measured by DXA, the REMS-measured T-score yielded a lower value of -1.8 ± 0.9. Analogously, the Z-score measured at the spine was -0.1 ± 1.3 with DXA and -0.8 ± 0.7 with REMS. Table 1. Bone health assessment of fractured and non-fractured patients for lumbar spine. Results are reported as average value ± SD and p-value are obtained using Wilcoxon paired test. *p<0.05 on the BMD, T-score and Z-score of the total cohort between DXA and REMS; **p<0.001 on the BMD, T-score and Z-score of non-fractured patients between DXA and REMS. Conclusion: These findings show that REMS is suitable to evaluate the bone mass in kidney transplant recipients patients. REMS technology is able to automatically discard bone artefacts, as aortic calcifications, typically reported in these patients, that could influence DXA diagnosis. Therefore, REMS may represent a valuable strategy for early identification and stratification of high-risk individuals susceptible to fracture following kidney transplantation. The difference betwewn dxa and REMS t score values in non fractured KTR patients can be due to the pathology itself. Further studies are required to elucidate whether the REMS outcome in non-fractured patients indeed translates into a clinically significant enhanced ability to identify bone damage in this specific setting.

This can be mainly explained by the chronic state of inflammation as well as corticosteroid use. According to some authors, there may be a connection between systemic and alveolar bone loss [1]. However, the relationship between osteoporosis and alveolar bone loss is not completely elucidated. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between bone mineral density and the presence of oral-dental anomalies in RA patients. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study involving patients with RA recruited from the rheumatology department of Mongi Slim Hospital. Sociodemographic data as well as those related to RA were transcribed (duration, joint deformities, extra-articular manifestations (EAM), immunological status, co-morbidities, treatment modalities, and disease activity assessed by the DAS28 (ESR) scores.). A dental consultation was provided to all patients. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) expressed in T-score and g/cm2. Osteoporosis was defined as a T-score ? -2.5. A significance threshold was set at p<0.05. Results: A total of 50 patients (43 women (86%) and 7 men (14%)) were included in the study. The mean age was 56 (10) years [30-75]. The mean disease duration was 9 (6) years [1-23]. Arterial hypertension (34%), diabetes (30%) and diffuse interstitial lung disease (22%) were the most common comorbidities and EAM. Only 16% of the patients were smokers. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 27 (9) kg/m2 [18.4-35], with 16% of the patients suffering from obesity. Thirty-one (62%) patients were treated with corticosteroids. The mean DAS28 (ESR) was 4.3(1.53)[2.02-7.9]. Oral examination revealed oral abnormalities in most patients (82%). Forty-six of them had a low BMD, with osteopenia in 52% and osteoporosis in 40%. Twelve patients were treated with bisphosphonates. There was no statistically significant association between the presence of dental abnormalities and disease activity (p=0.5). However, there was a statically significant association between oral cavity damage and low bone density (p=0.039). Conclusion: Our study highlighted the association between bone loss and poor oral hygiene in patients with RA. Optimal management of osteoporosis could promote good oral hygiene in this population.

However, the best management of osteoporosis in this population is yet to determine. Objectives: To evaluate bone mineral density and other clinical, analytical and demographic features related with the risk of bone fractures in an IBD cohort. Methods: Retrospective monocentric study including all the patients with IBD consecutively reffered from Gastroenterology to the Rheumatology Department in a tertiary university hospital between January of 2013 and October 2020. Demographic, clinical and analytical data and BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (total hip, femoral neck and lumbar spine) were collected at the time of the first visit in the Rheumatology outpatient center. Correlations between variables were evaluated by Spearman rank test and Mann-Whitney U test was used in the comparison analysis between groups (significance level at p<0.05), using SPSS 25.0 software. Results: A total of 222 patients were included: 128 (57.7%) females, mean age of 43.4 (±13.6) years, mean IBD duration of 11.6 (±9.7) years. Regarding IBD: 163 (73.4%) had Crohn's disease (CD) and 59 (26.6%) had ulcerative colitis (UC); azathioprine (41.9%) and infliximab (29.8%) were the most frequently used drugs; 10 patients (4.5%) were taking glucocorticoids, 104 (46.8%) had been previously treated with glucocorticoids and 65 (29.3%) had already been exposed to high doses of glucocorticoids (prednisolone equivalent dose ? 7.5 mg/day). Ten patients (4.5%) had previous fragility fractures and 32 (14.4%) fulfilled diagnostic criteria of osteoporosis by DXA (T score ? -2.5). One hundred eighty-one (81.5%) patients exhibited low levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (<30ng/mL), 24 (10.8%) had high levels of parathormone and 150 (67.6%) showed elevated serum concentrations of beta-carboxy-terminal type-1 collagen crosslinks (beta-CTX). Three patients (1.4%) were under treatment with bisphosphonates and 18 (8.1%) were taking calcium and/or vitamin D supplements. Of interest, serum levels of albumin correlated negatively with beta-CTX (r=-0.401; p<0.001) and positively with osteocalcin (r=0.259; p<0.001). Correlations between clinical/analytical variables and BMD are presented in Table 1. Patients under glucocorticoids had lower mean total hip BMD (0.874±0.159 vs 1.008±0.176; p=0.022) and femoral neck BMD values (0.797±0.174 vs 0.933±0.179; p=0.014) in comparison with the group of patients that were not taking glucocorticoids. No statistically significant differences in BMD values were found between the following subgroups: DC vs UC; normal vs low levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D; patients exposed vs not exposed to high doses of glucocorticoids. Conclusion: Our results show an important prevalence of undiagnosed and untreated osteoporosis in patients with IBD. Stronger correlations were found between clinical/analytical variables and femoral neck BMD. Of note are the weak correlations of BMD with acute-phase markers (negative correlation with erythrocyte sedimentation rate and positive correlations with hemoglobin and albumin) and of nutritional status (evaluated by albumin) with bone markers (negative correlation with the bone reabsorption marker beta-CTX and positive correlation with the bone formation marker osteocalcin).

JOUR,AB0609?RADIOFREQUENCY ECHOGRAPHIC MULTI-SPECTROMETRY FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF BOTH FEMORA IN PREGNANT WOMEN,"['Kirilova, E.', 'Kirilov, N.', 'Vladeva, S.']",2021,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.1061,"Background: Radiofrequency Echographic Multi-Spectrometry (REMS) is a non-ionizing innovative approach for the assessment of REMS-based bone mineral density (BMD) of the axial skeleton. The principle of the REMS technology is based on the analysis of native raw unfiltered ultrasound signals during an echographic scan of the lumbar spine or the femoral neck [1]. Several studies demonstrated the high concordance with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in terms of measured BMD with this novel technology [2,3]. In previous published literature it was envisaged to apply this technology for the examination of the axial bone density in pregnant women. Pregnancy-associated bone loss has been demonstrated as decreased bone mineral density (BMD) in previous studies [4]. Objectives: The aim of the current study is to compare the BMD values of both femora between pregnant and non-pregnant women matched for age and BMI using the novel REMS technology. Methods: Of total fifty women twenty pregnant women (40%) and thirty non-pregnant women (60%) were included in the study. The mean age of the pregnant women was 32 years ± 5 standard deviations (SD), (range 25-41 years) and the mean age of the non-pregnant women was 30 years ± 6 standard deviations (SD), (range 24-39 years). REMS approach was used to assess REMS-based BMD and REMS-based Z-score values of the femoral neck. Furthermore, body mass index (BMI) and gestational age in weeks were evaluated. Results: The mean BMI of the pregnant women was 26 kg/m2 ± 7 kg/m2 (range 14 kg/m2-42 kg/m2) and those of the non-pregnant women was 25 kg/m2 ± 5 kg/m2 (range 16 kg/m2-35 kg/m2). The mean gestational age was 20 weeks' gestation ± 5 weeks' gestation (range 13-27 weeks' gestation). REMS-based mean BMD of the left femoral neck of the pregnant women was 0.793 g/cm2 ± 0.167 g/cm2 (range 0.563 g/cm2-1.154 g/cm2). REMS-based mean BMD of the right femoral neck of the pregnant women was 0.828 g/cm2 ± 0.153 g/cm2 (range 0.570 g/cm2-1.161 g/cm2). After comparing left femoral neck BMD with the right femoral neck BMD of the pregnant women, we found a linear correlation (R=0.764). Left femoral neck BMD value (0.793 g/cm2) of the pregnant women was significantly lower than those of the non-pregnant women (0.854 g/cm2), p=0.002. The mean left femoral Z-score of the pregnant women (-0.1 SD with range -2.5 SD-2.9 SD) was also significantly lower compared to those of the non-pregnant women (1.2 SD with range -1.5 SD-3.1 SD), p=0.003. Conclusion: This is the first study which provides data about BMD and Z-score values of both femora in pregnant women assessed with the radiation-free REMS technology. Pregnant women demonstrated significantly lower femoral neck BMD values and Z-scores compared to those of the non-pregnant women. Innovative REMS method could be very helpful for making decision about the treatment of pregnant women who are at risk of lower BMD due to concomitant diseases and/or treatment associated with osteoporosis.

JOUR,AB0610?NORMOCALCAEMIC HYPERPARATHYROIDISM AND BONE HEALTH – WORSE THAN ANTICIPATED?,"['Masieh, D.', 'Deshpande, S.', 'Nisar, M.K.']",2021,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.1095,"Background: Since the formal recognition of normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism (nHPT) as a distinct entity in 2008, several studies have been published describing the characteristics of these individuals. Controversy exists regarding diagnostics and the role of parathyroidectomy in such cases. A chief reason for lack of consensus is the disagreement among experts regarding the potential complications and a bias towards perhaps benign nature of this condition. Objectives: In order to understand the challenges posed by this cohort, we aim to characterise these patients at presentation to our metabolic bone diseases unit with a focus on bone health. Methods: We interrogated our departmental database and undertook retrospective analysis of all patients presenting to metabolic bone service at our large university teaching hospital with a catchment population of 350,000. Individuals were included in the survey based on criteria of Vit D >70 nmol/L, normal calcium (2.20-2.60 mmol/L), eGFR>60ml/min and PTH >6.9 pmol/L measured twice at least three months apart. Results: Over six months review period, of 134 referrals, 42 (31%) were identified with nHPT. Follow up duration was two years. Mean age was 60 years (25-86). 38 (90%) were women with 31 (81%) post menopause. 34 (80%) were of Caucasian descent. All had comorbidities with median of five (1-14). Polypharmacy (>4 prescribed medicines) was common (36/42, 85%) with mean of seven prescribed medications (0-22). Mean Vit D was 88 (70.4-133.6), calcium 2.43 (2.26-2.58), creatinine 69.8 (48-115) and PTH 8.8 (7.2-14.2). Ten (24%) had already had fragility fractures with mean of two (0-4). 21 had DXA scan with mean T score of -3.78 (-2.1 - -6.0). 13/21(31%) had osteoporosis. Oral and IV bisphosphonates, denosumab and teriparatide were prescribed to 12 (28.5%), 14 (33%), 4 (10%) and one patient respectively. Conclusion: Our study suggests high prevalence of nHPT among patients referred to metabolic bone service with confirmed bone health issues. Nearly a third of patients have nHPT in this secondary care setting and a quarter have already suffered fragility fractures. These patients carry high comorbidity, polypharmacy and osteoporosis burden. Management of such patients is challenging owing to complex interplay of various ailments. Bone active agents are required for nearly two-thirds of this group. Though the natural course of nHPT is an area of active research, our data adds to the growing body of evidence that this is not a benign condition with particularly high fracture burden and poor bone quality. nHPT is perhaps responsible for the onset and progression of the similar osseous complications as described in classical PHPT. Further longitudinal studies are required to help devise best management plan to mitigate against the skeletal encumbrance of nHPT. Disclosure of Interests: None declared."

Rheumatoid arthritis is a well-known risk factor for the development of osteoporosis. With the introduction of radiofrequency echographic multi spectrometry (REMS), easily evaluation of the lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) ultrasound (BMDus) and hip BMDus is possible for early diagnosis of osteoporosis. Objectives The aim of this study is to compare the characteristics of the osteoporotic patients with and without rheumatoid arthritis through radiofrequency echographic multi spectrometry. Methods A total of 70 patients with osteoporosis were included in the study. 43% of them (30/70) had RA and 57% (40/70) were without RA. Patients were diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis if they had a score of 6/10 or higher based on 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA. Age, body mass index (BMI), lumbar spine BMDus, as well as total hip BMDus and fracture risk score (FRAX) were assessed. Results Patients with RA were significantly younger (69.3 ± 6.5 years) than those without RA (76.4 ± 5.0 years) (p = 0.002). BMI values did not differ significantly between the two groups (25.76 ± 4.82 kg/m2 for patients with RA and 27.57 ± 5.37 kg/m2 for patients without RA). Patients with and without RA did not show any significantly differences between BMDus values of L1-L4 (0.629/0.607 g/cm2 for L1, 0.692/0.688 g/cm2 for L2, 0.761/0.743 g/cm2 for L3 and 0.789/0.769 g/cm2 for L4). Patients with RA had higher total lumbar spine T-score (-2.6 ± 0.8 standard deviations) compared to those without RA (-3.1 ± 0.5 standard deviations), but this difference was not significant (p > 0.05). Femoral neck BMDus, trochanteric BMDus and total hip BMDus were similar in the groups with and without RA (0.550/0.548 g/cm2 for femoral neck, 0.710/0.693 g/cm2 for trochanter, 0.688/0.678 g/cm2 for total hip). FRAX score of the patients with RA was significantly higher (32.89% for 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture and 14.29% for 10-year probability of hip fracture) compared to the patients without RA (22.36% for 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture and 8.75% 10-year probability of hip fracture). Conclusion Although there were no significant differences in lumbar spine BMDus values and total hip BMDus values between the patients with and without RA, patients with RA showed higher 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture.

JOUR,AB0839?ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BODY FAT AND BONE MINERAL DENSITY IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN THROUGH RADIOFREQUENCY ECHOGRAPHIC MULTI SPECTROMETRY,"['Kirilova, Elena', 'Kirilov, Nikola', 'Vladeva, Stoyanka']",2019,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2019-eular.2210,"Background Osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk. Age, concomitant diseases, body mass index (BMI), body composition, etc. are important risk factors that could reflect on bone density and on the increased risk of fractures. Although obesity has been associated with increased bone mineral density (BMD) in the most studies, the relationship between body fat and BMD remains contradictive. Objectives The aim of this study is to determine if there is any association between body fat distribution and bone mineral density in postmenopausal women through novel ultrasound technique applicable on both-lumbar spine and femoral neck. Methods A total of 98 women with mean age 62 ± 11 years underwent radiofrequency echographic multi spectrometry (REMS). Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) software was used to assess body fat percentage. Patients were divided into two groups-with body fat ? 32% and body fat < 32%. Age, BMI, lumbar spine BMD, total hip BMD and fracture risk score (FRAX) were compared between the patients with normal body fat and those with high body fat. Results The mean age of the women with normal body fat was 61.1±14.6 years and the mean age of the women with high body fat was 63.3±9.5 years. BMI of the women with body fat < 32% was significantly lower (22.5 kg/cm2) compared to the BMI of the women with body fat ? 32% (30.2 kg/cm2) (p = 0.000). Bone mineral density of L1-L4 and total lumbar spine BMD did not differ between the women with normal body fat and high body fat. Femoral neck BMD, trochanteric BMD and total hip BMD of the patients with normal body fat (0.604 g/cm2, 0.737 g/cm2 and 0.736 g/cm2 respectively) were significantly lower than those patients with high body fat (0.682 g/cm2, 0.864 g/cm2 and 0.838 g/cm2 respectively) (p = 0.000 for femoral neck BMD and trochanteric BMD, and p = 0.001 for total hip BMD). FRAX score for 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture did not differ significantly between the two groups (20.8% for women with normal body fat and 16.6% for women with high body fat). FRAX score for 10-year probability of hip fracture was also not significant between the two groups, but there was a trend to statistical significance (p = 0.059) (9% for women with normal fat and 4.9% for women with high fat). Conclusion Postmenopausal women with body fat ? 32% showed higher femoral neck BMD compared to those with body fat < 32%, but there was no significant difference in the lumbar spine BMD values between the groups. Women with high body fat did not show significantly lower FRAX score than the women with normal body fat.

JOUR,AB0840?SCREENING FOR OSTEOPOROSIS IN AN AMBULATORY AND HOSPITALIZED POPULATION: A 6-YEAR EXPERIENCE IN A UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL,"['Malaise, Olivier', 'Detroz, Marie', 'Leroy, Mathieu', 'Leonori, Lorenzo', 'Seidel, Laurence', 'Malaise, Michel']",2019,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2019-eular.4221,"Background Osteoporosis (OP) is a serious and prevalent disease identified by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) that can be performed in an ambulatory or an hospitalized population. Objectives Aims are: (1) to characterize patients who had DEXA in a university department of rheumatology to study its diagnostic efficacy; (2) to look after risk factors specific to our population; (3) to evaluate the efficiency of a non-systematic and opportunistic intra-hospital OP screening by comparing results for ambulatory and hospitalized patients in the different departments of the hospital. Methods From 2007 to 2012, 6406 initial DEXA from consecutive patients were prospectively encoded (1494 in 2007, 1158 in 2008, 1079 in 2009, 945 in 2010, 868 in 2011 and 862 in 2012) (identical DEXA). Results Cohort characteristics are the following: women 74.4%, mean age (± 1 standard deviation) 60.5 years (± 14.3), mean BMI 25.1 (± 5.1), history of corticotherapy in 30.5%, previous fracture in 29% and current hospitalization in 28.8% of cases. OP (at one of the 3 sites) was diagnosed in 22.3%, a stable value over the years, with, as a repartition, lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip OP in 13.7%, 13.6% and 9.2% respectively. In 3.9%, OP was diagnosed at all the 3 sites. In univariate analysis, OP risk factors were age, history of fracture and low BMI (for all 3 sites), corticotherapy (lumbar spine and femoral neck) and male gender (lumbar spine). In multivariate analysis, regardless of site, age, fracture history, low BMI, and male gender increased the OP risk. Intra-hospital screening identified OP (at any of the 3 sites) in 31.8% (vs 18.5%, p<0.001 for ambulatory screening) and OP at 3 sites simultaneously in 7.9% (vs 2.3%, p <0.0001). This better efficiency was stable and present for each year analyzed. The intra-hospital population tested was older [64.2 years (13.2) vs 59 (13.2), p<0.0001], with more men (35.2% vs 21.7, p<0.0001), more history of fracture (39% vs 24, p<0.0001) and with a slightly higher BMI [25.4 (5.8) vs 25.1 (4.8), p=0.028], with no difference in corticosteroid use. In addition to T-scores analyzes, Z-scores were also compared and showed similar differences with lower Z-scores in the hospitalized population. Conclusion (1) One in five DEXA identified OP at one of the three sites in the ambulatory population but only one in three in the hospitalized patients. Hospital screening is therefore essential and more efficient than the ambulatory one. Hospital time seems to be an opportunity to fill the gaps in ambulatory screening.(2) Intra–hospital screening targeted an older and more masculine population with more fracture history, which may explain its better performance, which does not decline over the years. Z–score differences revealed that the efficiency difference was not only due to an older age of the hospitalized population but could be secondary to more internistical co–morbidities or treatment deleterious for bones.(3) In addition to conventional ones, the male gender is a risk factor for OP, recalling the importance of screening for all and not only in the female population (which represents ¾ of the cohort).

It has been reported in several studies, an incidence of fracture between 30-40% in this population. Objectives To evaluate the evolution of bone turnover biomarkers before and after treatment (according to 2015 NOF guidelines) and to describe the incidence of fracture after a SCI. Methods A prospective study was conducted, including 48 SCI patients followed during an observation period of 24 months, with visits every six months. Thirty two patients concluded the study. In each visit patients were enquired about fractures. A blood test was also performed. In addition a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and simple x-ray of hip and spine was requested annually. Patients were also educated in lifestyle measures, such as an adequate calcium and vitamin D dietary intake. Oral supplementation was initiated in cases of low intake or deficit, respectively. In patients with bone mineral density (BMD) measured by DEXA in range of Osteoporosis, pharmacological therapy was initiated (bisphosphonate or Denosumab). Statistics had been performed with mixed linear regression models. Results Our sample was 56.25% men with an average age of 56.08 ± 13.82 years old. In 32 patients (68.09%) low Vitamin D levels were detected. At baseline in 12 cases (25%) DEXA showed a BMD in osteoporosis range; in 12 (25%) osteopenia, plus 6 fractures (2.6 fractures per 100 years/patient). Afterwards, until the end of the study only a fracture of the tibia was observed (however, it was after a high impact accident), so the fracture rate was 1.2 fractures per 100 year/patient. The evolution of the variables can be seen on the next table. On multivariate analysis an inverse relationship between vitamin D and CTX levels was detected (p? 0.05). DEXA hip measures tend to become stabilized after Bisphosphonate treatment. Conclusion On our cohort, bone resorption biomarkers decrease after Vitamin D restoring. Antiresorptive therapy in high risk patients stopped bone loss, especially in hip. After two years follow up, with the treatment algorithm applied, fracture incidence was lower than other series published.

Objectives Since PTH has a limited period of approved use, a short term (6 months) use of PTH in combination with Dmab followed by continued use of Dmab may show a sustained synergistic effect of the combination. Methods The BMD trends from real time data from a central dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at our centre in India was studied retrospectively to see if the effect was sustained. Women with postmenopausal osteoporosis who were treated with a combination of Dmab 60 mg via subcutaneous injection (sc) at 6 monthly interval along with PTH 20 mcg sc daily for the first 6 months (Combo), followed by Dmab alone for the next six months were inculded in the study group. Average BMD at L2, L3 and L4 (sp BMD), and Right and Left Hip (hip BMD) were studied from before treatment (a BMD), after the Combo treatment (b BMD) and after 6 months of the second injection of Dmab (c BMD). The mean percentage trend change between a-b BMD and b-c BMD were evaluated. Out of the patients treated with the protocol, 25 were randomly chosen for the retrospective analysis. The least significant change (LSC) 2 from a single centre DXA was used to validate the findings. Results The percentage change after the treatment for 6 months with the Combo was found to be 5.22% in the Spine (LSC= 2.6%)2 and 4.13% in the hip (LSC=3.6%)2. The trend after use of Dmab alone was 5.39% in the spine and 2.93% in the hip showing sustained synergistic effect of the Combo for at least 6 months with the use of Dmab alone. The effect was more profound in the spine than the hip. A p>0.05 was considered statistically significant. Table 1 shows the percentage BMD changes.

Conclusion These findings suggest that a short term combination of Dmab and PTH for 6 months followed by Dmab alone shows sustained synergistic effect on the BMD trend which was more profound in the spine than the hip. This would help in judicious and cost effective utilisation of the limited period of PTH use.

JOUR,AB1016?ROMOSOZUMAB AS A TREATMENT FOR OSTEOPOROSIS: PREDICTORS OF EFFICACY AT 12 MONTHS,"['Hirano, Y.', 'Ono, Y.']",2022,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.2194,"Background Romosozumab (ROMO) is an antisclerostin antibody that is used in the treatment of severe osteoporosis (OP). In March 2019, ROMO was approved for use in Japan for treating severe OP in clinical practice, causing an increase in its prescription in our institute. Although efficacy data for ROMO have been presented in clinical trials, there is a lack of real-world data. In our experience, ROMO treatment results in significant bone mineral density (BMD) gain in some patients, but not all. Therefore, understanding the predictors that enhance the efficacy of ROMO treatments to achieve BMD gain is essential. Objectives This study investigated the efficacy of a 12-month ROMO treatment in patients with OP and explored the efficacy predictors of increased BMD. Methods Our study included 52 patients with OP, who were started on ROMO treatment between June 2019 and August 2020. The following information was collected: 1) baseline characteristics, 2) time-course of BMD (lumbar spine [LS] and total hip [TH]) and bone turnover markers (BTM; bone-specific alkaline phosphatase [BAP], type I procollagen-N-propeptide [P1NP], type I procollagen-N-propeptide[NTX], and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b [TRACP-5b]), 3) multiple regression analysis results following Spearman's correlation analysis of increased BMD values (%) at 12 months and BL characteristics, including BTM change (%) at one month, to investigate the efficacy predictors of ROMO. Results 1) The mean age of the participants was 72.9 years (48 female and four male). Of the 52 understudied patients, 78.8% had past insufficiency fractures, whereas 21.2% had been treated with concomitant prednisolone. Furthermore, 21 patients had primary OP, 20 had rheumatoid arthritis, nine had glucocorticoid-induced OP, and two had other conditions. Pretreatments for OP were bisphosphonate (33 patients), vitamin D (6), none (5), selective estrogen receptor modulator (4), and denosumab (3). 2) Both mean LS- and TH-BMD significantly increased in the patients for whom ROMO administration was continued for 12 months. The average percentage changes of LS- and TH-BMD were 7.1% and 1.6% at six months and 11.7% and 3.0% at 12 months, respectively (Figure 1). However, BAP and P1NP increased steeply at one month, followed by a gradual decrease. As observed, the average percentage changes of BAP and P1NP were +70.1% and +166.8% at one month, +50.3% and +91.7% at six months, and +24.4% and +41.5% at 12 months, respectively. The results also showed that TRACP-5b decreased from one to 12 months, with the average percentage changes being ?22.9% at one month, ?13.8% at six months, and ?17.7% at 12 months. Moreover, NTX, a bone-resorptive marker, was slightly increased during ROMO treatment. 3) Multiple regression analysis results revealed that the baseline BAP and percentage calcium changes at 12 months were significant factors positively correlated with the percentage change of LS-BMD at 12 months. As observed, the baseline T-score of LS-BMD was a significant factor negatively correlated with the percentage change of LS-BMD at 12 months. The standardized partial regression coefficient values were +0.68, +0.26, and ?0.40, respectively. Moreover, the multiple regression analysis results revealed no significant factor that was correlated with the percentage changes of TH-BMD at 12 months.

Objectives The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the REMS BMD assessment with dual-energy X-rays absorptiometry (DXA) in a cohort of patients affected by end-stage renal disease undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Methods Consecutive patients referring to the PD clinic of our hospital were enrolled. Lumbar spine and proximal femur REMS scans were performed, and lumbar spine (anteroposterior and laterolateral) and proximal femur DXA scans were performed as well. Clinical data were extracted from medical records. The risk assessment outputs of two fracture risk algorithms (FRAX and DeFRA), calculated upon the worst BMD obtained from either technique were compared as well. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc analysis (Bonferroni) and a two-sided Student's t-test were used to estimate the absolute differences between groups. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants included (protocol 1483 CESC). Results 41 total patients were enrolled (Table 1). No significant differences were documented between the BMD T-scores measured through DXA or REMS at the proximal femur. At the lumbar spine, the DXA laterolateral T-score was not significantly different from that of REMS, while the DXA anteroposterior T-score was significantly higher than both the anteroposterior DXA and the REMS measurements (Figure 1, panel A and B). When either DXA or REMS was adopted, no significant difference in the fracture risk estimate was found for both algorithms (Figure 1, panel C and D).

Objectives to study the relationship between the degree of AOC and DXA and Radiofrequency Echographic Multi-Spectrometry (REMS) acquisitions. Methods Consecutive patients referring to the PD our clinic were enrolled. Lumbar spine (LS) and proximal femur REMS scans were performed, and LS (anteroposterior and laterolateral) and proximal femur DXA scans were performed as well. The degree of AOC was assessed through the semiquantitative score described by Kauppila et al, and applied to the laterolateral LS DXA scans. To test for correlations between different variables, we used the Pearson's correlation for continuous variables and Spearman's rho for discrete variables. Multiple regression analysis was performed to adjust for age and body mass index (BMI) the correlation between BMD and the CKD duration. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants (protocol 1483CESC). Results 41 total patients were enrolled (29 males, 19 females). Median disease duration of CKD [IQR]: 132 months [48-140]. 15% had vertebral fractures at the DXA Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA). The median calcification score [IQR] was 2 [0-6] (min-max 0-20). We found a statistically significant positive correlation of moderate strength between the total calcification score and the difference between the DXA AP T-score and the DXA LL T-score at the LS (p<0.01, Spearman's rho = 0.402), Figure 1.

By this age, men reach an increased bone mass that starts declining in their fifties, however less rapidly than women after menopause. However, men and women lose bone mass at the same rate by age 65-70, becoming fragile and more likely to have fracture. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy in osteoporosis diagnosis of Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS) technology applied on the proximal femur in an adult male population in comparison with the Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). Methods A cohort of Caucasian males was enrolled in the study. Inclusion criteria were: age between 30 and 90 years, body mass index (BMI) less than 40 kg/m2, no significant walking impairments and proximal femur DXA medical prescription. All the enrolled patients underwent proximal femur scans with both DXA and REMS. The agreement between REMS and DXA-measured BMD was expressed by Pearson correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman method. The classification into patients “with osteoporosis” or “without osteoporosis” was carried out considering the conventional threshold of T-score (-2.5) for both techniques independently. The accuracy was evaluated by the assessment of sensitivity and specificity considering the DXA outcome as reference [1]. Results A total of 219 men were included in the analysis, with mean age of 55.5 (± 15.3) years. The Pearson correlation coefficient between REMS- and DXA-measured BMD values was r=0.94. At Bland-Altman analysis, Bias ± 1.96 Standard Deviation were -0.004 ± 0.04 g/cm2. The REMS capability to discriminate osteoporotic patients from non-osteoporotic ones was very high: a sensitivity of 90.0% and specificity of 91.8% was detected. Conclusion REMS, applied to the proximal femur site, is a reliable technology for the diagnosis of osteoporosis also in men, thus confirming the diagnostic performance already observed in studies carried out in female populations [1, 2].

(1) There is convincing evidence that with or without the use of BMD it provides a well-validated instrument and may be useful in clinical practice for identifying patients at high risk of fracture and informing treatment decisions. (2) Objectives This study aims to determine the concordance between the treatment decision, calculated using FRAX scores with and without BMD, and to identify the risk factors associated with the discordance in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases who had undergone osteoporosis detection (OP) using dual bone densitometry in the Rheumatology service of the University Hospital “Dr. José Eleuterio González” during the period August 2020 - August 2021. The FRAX questionnaire was applied to determine risk factors for OP and the results of the instrument with and without BMD were calculated, the patients were classified as low, intermediate, and high risk. A Student's t-test, a Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and a Chi-square or Fisher's exact test were used to compare variables between groups and calculate P-values. Results A total of 88 patients were included. Based on FRAX questionnaire responses, 82 (93.18%) patients had at least one risk factor for OP. The FRAX result with or without densitometry resulted in a treatment decision in 48 (54.5%) and 28 (31.8%) patients, respectively. The results were concordant in 65 (73.9%) of the cases. It was found that patients with osteopenia due to BMD had a greater agreement between both measurements (93.3%, p 0.003) than patients with normal BMD (62.5% p 0.001). Likewise, patients with secondary osteoporosis had lower concordance than patients without this diagnosis (25% and 72.5%, respectively, p 0.006). Conclusion The results of FRAX with and without densitometry were mostly agreeable in predicting the need for treatment according to the 10-year probability of hip fracture, however, this concordance decreased in patients with a previous diagnosis of secondary osteoporosis, no significant difference was found between the risk factors for the concordant and discordant groups. More studies are required to determine the variables that cause a decrease in the concordance of the tests.

JOUR,ABS0905ULTRASONOGRAPHIC EVALUATION OF TENDON INVOLVEMENT IN SECONDARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM IN CHRONIC HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS,"['Layachi, Y.', 'Tidrarine, S.', 'Bighouab, H.', 'Kada, S.', 'Ahbibi, S.', 'Chakhmane, R.', 'Benabdelmalek, N.', 'Rachidi, S.', 'Raja, A.', 'Kahaji, B.', 'Aitmalek, S.', 'Lahlou, L.', 'Ghozlani, I.', 'Erraoui, M.']",2025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ard.2025.06.1180,"Background: Secondary hyperparathyroidism is one of the manifestations of mineral and bone disorders related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is characterized by an increase in the level of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which promotes bone resorption, particularly at the tendon insertion sites (entheses). The consequences of these lesions are not negligible. They have a negative impact on quality of life by causing pain, functional restrictions and physical disabilities. In addition, they increase the risk of fractures and tendon ruptures, exacerbating the morbidity of hemodialysis patients. These tendon complications, although significant, remain insufficiently studied [1]. Objectives: The objective of the study is to investigate the characteristics of tendon involvement in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing regular hemodialysis and to examine its correlation with parathyroid hormone levels using ultrasonography. Methods: This prospective and interventional study on a population of 14 chronic hemodialysis patients was carried out from February to July 2024 in the rheumatology department of the Souss Massa University Hospital in Agadir in coordination with the hemodialysis unit. An osteoarticular ultrasound was performed in all patients by an expert rheumatologist. The study focused on the Achilles and quadricipitals tendons bilaterally. Results: In our study, the median age of the participants was 57.5 years, with a female predominance of 71.4%. Causative nephropathy was mainly attributed to vascular involvement and to an undetermined cause, each accounting for 35.7% of cases. The median duration of hemodialysis was 4 years. The prevalence of secondary hyperparathyroidism was 50% with a median of parathyroid hormone concentration 527.7pg/l. The median serum calcium was 87 mg/L and the median phosphorus was 48.5 mg/L. Ultrasound explorations revealed a total of 76.8% of abnormalities detected in the entire tendon (body and enthesis). Tendon thickening was present in 42.9% of cases, mainly in the tendon body, and calcifying deposits in 58.9% of cases, located in the entheses. Regarding the correlation between parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and different demographic and biological variables, no statistically significant results were found except for vitamin D. The p-values were, respectively: age (p = 0.75), sex (p = 0.96), duration of hemodialysis (p = 0.16), serum calcium (p = 0.65), phosphoremia (p = 0.75), vitamin D (p = 0.05). For ultrasound abnormalities, enthesis evaluation revealed significant correlations between serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations and enthesis thickening (p = 0.05). For the rest of the abnormalities, no correlation was found with tendon thickening (p = 0.84), structural abnormalities (p = 0.29) and calcifying deposits. Also at the level of the entire tendon including the body and the enthesis, no significant correlation was detected with a p= 0.67. Conclusion: Ultrasound tendon abnormalities in chronic hemodialysis patients are common. The link between the frequency of these abnormalities and hyperparathyroidism is theoretical, confirmed in some studies. In our series, there is a link between thickening of the entheses and high levels of PTH [1]. REFERENCES: [1] Hussein DA, El-Azizi NO, Meged AH, Al-Hoseiny SA, Hamada AM, Sabry MH.

JOUR,ABS1128?DRUG SURVIVAL AND ADHERENCE OF BIOLOGICS AND TARGETED SYNTHETIC DISEASE-MODIFYING AGENTS AMONG PATIENTS WITH ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS- A REAL-WORLD STUDY,"['Magrey, M.', 'Murphy, J.E.']",2025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ard.2025.06.1788,"Background: Treatment adherence is crucial for achieving disease control in axial spondylarthritis. Objectives: The study aimed to investigate the real-world drug survival and adherence of Biologics tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), interleukin-17 inhibitors (IL-17i), and Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) among patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Methods: We performed a retrospective study using a de-identified federated database with 89 contributing healthcare organizations, including over 125 million patients (TriNetX Research Network, Cambridge, MA; date of data access: May 28, 2024). All adult patients with a diagnosis of AS (ICD-10: M45.9) 1) ? 18 years at the index date of diagnosis between the years of 1953 and 2024, and 3) initially treated with one of three therapeutic classes: TNFi, IL-17i, or Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) for a minimum of 90 days on or after the date of their AS diagnosis. The primary outcome, medication non-adherence, is defined as a switch in medication class within 180 days of the initial prescription date. The analysis excludes patients who received combination therapy (i.e., multiple medications prescribed on the same date) and those who did not meet the minimum 90-day adherence requirement. Logistic regression assessed the association between primary non-adherence and medication class, with calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Time to treatment discontinuation was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression and visualized with Kaplan-Meier curves. Results for both unweighted and weighted models, adjusted for demographics, and comorbidities using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Results: The study included 14,027 patients with AS, 12,562 of whom were initiated on TNFi, 1,133 on IL-17i, and 332 on JAKi. The baseline characteristics and demographics are shown in Table 1. The anti-TNF group included more males (51.3%) with younger mean age (44.0± 14.4) compared to anti- IL-17 group (46.4± 13.6) and JAKi (52.7±13.9). The patients on IL-17i had a higher mean BMI (30.7 kg/m2 ± 7.0), and the patients on JAKi had a higher burden of co-morbidities, including depression, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and extra-articular manifestations like Crohn's disease, and psoriasis. The risk of non adherence was seen in 2.1% on TNFi, 7.1% on IL-17i and 9% on JAKi. The odds of non-adherence were significantly higher in patients initially prescribed IL-17i (OR= 3.16, 95% CI:2.41, 4.10) and JAKi (OR= 5.18 95% CI: 3.50, 7.45) than in patients initially prescribed anti-TNF.These findings are consistent before and after weighting for demographics and comorbidities (Table 2). The Kaplan-Meier analysis (Figure 3) showed a high medication adherence probability with TNFi. The TPTW-adjusted model corroborated these findings. Conclusion: Our study, utilizing a longitudinal clinical and claims database, showed that adherence and drug survival were significantly higher in the anti-TNF therapy group compared to anti-IL17 and JAK inhibitors in this cohort of AS patients. Caregivers may consider these results when making treatment decisions.

JOUR,ABS1134?FRAGILITY SCORE IN RADIOGRAPHIC AXIAL SPONDYLOARTHRITIS ASSESSED WITH RADIOFREQUENCY ECHOGRAPHIC MULTI-SPECTROMETRY (REMS),"['Bischoff, E.', 'Kirilov, N.', 'Baraliakos, X.']",2025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ard.2025.06.1789,"Background: A reduction of bone mineral density (BMD) is frequent already early in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) due to systemic and local inflammatory activity. Although Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) remains the standard for diagnosing osteoporosis and assessing fracture risk, BMD measure alone is insufficient in radiographic (r)-axSpA due to the formation of syndesmophytes, while the trabecular bone score (TBS) may provide some additional information. Radiofrequency Echographic Multi-Spectrometry (REMS) is an innovative technology based on ultrasound signals performed by an echographic scan. Objectives: To prospectively evaluate REMS-based fragility scores (FS) and fracture risk in r-axSpA patients and compare them with healthy controls. Methods: An EchoStudio device (Echolight S.p.a., Lecce, Italy) with a 3.5 MHz transducer was used for a trans-abdominal scan of the L1-L4 vertebrae. The device generates a patient-specific spectrum to estimate BMD and corresponding T-score, with FS ranging from 0 to 100 to assess skeletal fragility independently of BMD. Lower FS values indicate better bone quality and lower fracture risk. The risk class (R1–R7) is determined by combining FS and REMS T-scores, with higher classes indicating higher fracture risk. FS on the lumbar spine predicts total risk for major osteoporotic fractures (MOF) per 5 years. Results: We assessed the FS of the spine using REMS in 25 established r-axSpA subjects and compared them to 50 unmatched controls. The mean age of r-axSpA subjects was 48±6 years (40–60 years). The mean age of the control group was 56±7 years (range 50-70 years). The mean body mass index (BMI) of r-axSpA subjects was 27.5±4.5 kg/m² (range 22-32 kg/m²). The mean BMI of the control group was 32.5±6 kg/m² (range 27-40 kg/m²). Overall, 60% of the axSpA and 64% of the control group subjects were female. The FS of r-axSpA subjects (45.6±16.5, R5 category, indicating an intermediate fracture risk, bordering on high fracture risk for MOF in the next 5 years) was significantly higher than that of the control group (33.2±16.3, R4 category, indicating an intermediate fracture risk range for MOF in the next 5 years but was not as close to the high fracture risk threshold), p=0.004. The total REMS-based BMD and T-score for the lumbar spine in r-axSpA subjects (0.809 g/cm²; -1.3 SD) did not differ from the control group (0.815 g/cm²; -1.2 SD). Conclusion: Despite no significant difference in lumbar spine BMD between r-axSpA subjects and controls, the FS was significantly higher in the r-axSpA group, indicating an increased fracture risk. The FS, as measured by REMS, provides valuable insights into bone quality beyond BMD, suggesting that r-axSpA patients may experience altered bone microarchitecture and increased fragility despite similar BMD values. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating REMS-based FS assessments into clinical practice for better fracture risk stratification in r-axSpA patients, potentially guiding more effective management strategies to prevent fractures and improve patient outcomes.

JOUR,ABS1141?ULTRASONOGRAPHIC EVALUATION OF THORACOLUMBAR FASCIA MORPHOLOGY IN AXIAL SPONDYLOARTHROPATHY AND CONTROLS: A PILOT STUDY WITH CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF MYOFASCIAL TRIGGER POINTS,"['Sidzhimli, Y.', 'Güne?, S.', 'Kahveci, A.', 'Gökmen, D.', 'Ataman, ?.']",2025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ard.2025.06.1790,"Background: Axial Spondyloarthropathy (ax-SpA) is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by widespread back and spinal pain, often resulting in significant functional limitations and reduced quality of life [1]. The thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) plays a crucial role in biomechanical stability by transmitting and distributing forces across the spine and torso [2]. Beyond its mechanical properties, the TLF has nociceptive capabilities, contributing to pain perception through inflammatory or structural changes. Microinjuries, adhesions, or inflammation can lead to sensitization of dorsal horn neurons, exacerbating pain signals and creating a feedback loop of chronic discomfort [3, 4]. Previous studies have implicated the TLF as a significant contributor to chronic low back pain (CLBP), revealing associations with increased thickness, restricted mobility, and altered morphology [2, 3]. While the structural role of the TLF in chronic pain has been explored extensively, its relationship with inflammatory conditions like ax-SpA remains underinvestigated. Moreover, the presence of painful myofascial trigger points (MTPs), which are common in CLBP, has not been evaluated in the context of ax-SpA. Objectives: This study aims to address this gap by investigating the relationships between TLF thickness, morphology (via ultrasonography), and the presence of MTPs in ax-SpA patients compared to healthy controls. By utilizing ultrasonography, a reliable and non-invasive diagnostic tool, the study seeks to explore the potential of TLF-related changes as biomarkers for disease activity and progression in ax-SpA. Methods: 84 patients diagnosed with ax-SpA according to ASAS criteria and 58 healthy individuals were included. Demographic data for all of the participants were recorded. All patients had Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI), Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Score (MASES), Bath Ankylosing Radiology Index (BASRI), Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score-CRP (ASDASCRP), Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score-ESR (ASDASESR), Ankylosing Spondylitis Activity Score Health Index (ASASHI), ASASFI, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), sedimentation and CRP values were recorded. The presence of painful myofascial trigger points was evaluated by physical examination, and thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) thickness and morphology by ultrasonography. Results: The mean age of 74 ax-SpA individuals included in the study (42 female, 32 male) was 42.96±10.53 years (min: 20, max: 68), mean disease duration was 8.40±82 years, and mean BMI was 28.09±4.99 kg/cm2 (min: 18.38, max: 39.35). The control group included 58 people (37 female, 21 male), mean age was 41.41±10.18 years (min: 23, max: 63), mean BMI was 26.07±3.57 kg/cm2 (min: 17.90, max: 33.02). The mean TLF thickness was measured as 2.73±0.65 mm in the ax-SpA group and 2.52±0.78 mm in the control group. The presence of MTPs was detected simmilarly in both groups, 66.2% and 60.3% respectively. The ax-SpA group showed a higher prevalence of irregular right and left thoracolumbar morphology compared to the control group (p=0,048, p=0,047). Greater thoracolumbar fascia thickness was strongly associated with irregularities in thoracolumbar morphology (p<0,001). Higher BMI was associated with irregular morphological changes (r = 0.386, p < 0.001) and increased thickness (r = 0.284, p = 0.014) of TLF in ax-SpA group. A weak to moderate positive correlation indicating a potential relationship between presence of myofascial trigger points and increased TLF thickness has been found in both groups (r=0.239,p=0.006), (r=0.297,p=0.027). Conclusion: This study highlights that morphological irregularities and increased thoracolumbar fascia thickness are more prevalent in ax-SpA patients compared to controls, with BMI showing moderate but significant associations with these structural measures. These findings underscore the potential mechanical influence of body composition on thoracolumbar fascia and its role in ax-SpA pathology. The weak relationship between trigger points and fascia thickness suggests that other factors may contribute to myofascial pain. Assessing thoracolumbar fascia morphology and thickness using ultrasonography could serve as a useful adjunct in monitoring structural changes in ax-SpA patients. However, further longitudinal studies are warranted to evaluate whether these changes predict disease progression or treatment response. REFERENCES: [1] Tesarz J, Hoheisel U, Wiedenhöfer B, Mense S.

JOUR,Comparative diagnostic performance of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and other radiological modalities in osteoporosis detection: a systematic review,"['Wali, Muwaffaq F.', 'Hariri, Osama Adnan', 'Alotiabi, Rasha E.', 'Waked, Badr K', 'Almudayni, Najla M.', 'Khashab, Faisal M.', 'Alshahrani, Batool A.', 'Aljaaly, Khalid M.', 'Alzahrani, Abdulrahman O.', 'Wally, Siraj Fahad']",2025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocd.2025.101637,"A serious worldwide health issue, osteoporosis is characterized by weakened bones and a higher risk of fracture. Though alternative imaging modalities like quantitative ultrasound (QUS), radiographic absorptiometry (RA), quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and radiofrequency echographic multispectrometry (REMS) have emerged as viable diagnostic or screening tools, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is still the gold standard for measuring bone mineral density (BMD). The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the clinical usefulness, diagnostic accuracy, and dependability of different radiographic modalities for osteoporosis detection. In order to find papers published between 2001 and 2023 comparing DEXA with other radiographic modalities for osteoporosis diagnosis, a thorough search of the PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases was undertaken. There were ten studies that qualified. Study design, demographic characteristics, imaging methods, diagnostic thresholds, and performance metrics (sensitivity, specificity, and correlation coefficients) were among the data that were extracted. Across studies, DEXA consistently demonstrated high precision and strong correlation with fracture risk, confirming its role as the reference standard. QUS showed moderate agreement with DEXA, supporting its use as a screening tool but not for diagnostic confirmation. RA provided good reproducibility but lower sensitivity compared with DEXA. QCT exhibited superior sensitivity (up to 91%) and early trabecular bone detection but was limited by higher cost and radiation exposure. Emerging evidence for REMS demonstrated strong correlation with DEXA (r?=?0.85–0.90), comparable diagnostic accuracy, and the advantage of being radiation-free and portable. DEXA remains the gold standard for osteoporosis diagnosis; however, QCT and REMS show promising diagnostic accuracy and may complement DEXA for early detection and longitudinal monitoring. QUS and RA can serve as cost-effective screening tools, particularly in settings where DEXA is unavailable. Further large-scale, prospective studies with standardized diagnostic thresholds are needed to validate these findings and optimize imaging strategies for osteoporosis management."

The primary outcome of the present work was to assess the BMD in a group of healthy pregnant women. Study design In this prospective case – control observational study, a non-consecutive group of pregnant women with uncomplicated pregnancy at or >37?weeks were enrolled at the unit of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Parma, from February to December 2020. The study subjects were submitted to a sonographic examination of the proximal femur with Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS) technology to quantify the BMD of the femur. The BMD values obtained in the study group were compared with those of a control group of non-pregnant women matched for age, ethnicity and pre-pregnant body mass index (BMI). Results Overall, 78 pregnant women at 39.1?±?1.5?weeks were assessed. Compared with non-pregnant women, the femoral BMD values measured in pregnancy using REMS were significant lower (0.769?±?0.094?g/cm2 vs 0.831?±?0.101?g/cm2, p?=?0.0001) with a mean BMD reduction of 8.1%. The femoral neck BMD presented a positive correlation with the pre-pregnant BMI (p?=?0.0004) and a negative correlation with the maternal age (p?<?0.0001). In addition, a lower femoral neck BMD in Caucasian ethnicity compared with non-Caucasian was noted (p?<?0.0001). Conclusion In this exploratory and proof of concept study, for the first time, a decreased BMD has been objectively demonstrated in pregnant compared with non-pregnant women by means of REMS technology. New studies are required to assess the longitudinal changes of maternal bone density throughout the pregnancy."

FIL significantly improved multiple disease domains vs placebo (PBO) in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in the multicenter, double-blind, phase 2 EQUATOR trial (NCTNCT03101670) [1]. Objectives To evaluate the effect of FIL vs PBO on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in EQUATOR and the extent to which effects on composite disease endpoints translate to clinically relevant improvements for patients. Methods Patients were randomized 1:1 to FIL 200 mg or PBO once daily for 16 weeks [1]. Patients Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PtGADA), pain intensity (visual analog scale), Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS), and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue scale (FACIT-F) were assessed at week 16. Analysis of covariance was used to compare changes from baseline in outcomes between groups. Proportions of patients achieving normative PRO scores or minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) were compared using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests [2, 3]. Results FIL significantly improved multiple PROs vs PBO at week 16 (Table). Proportions of patients reaching normative PRO values for FACIT-F and SF-36 PCS (=40 or 50, respectively), and achieving MCIDs in HAQ-DI and SF-36 PCS, were significantly greater for FIL vs PBO (Table). Significant improvement in 6/8 SF-36 domains was observed at week 16 with FIL vs PBO (Fig a). Improvement in most individual FACIT-F items was also observed (Fig b). Conclusion In EQUATOR, FIL-treated patients with active PsA reported greater and clinically meaningful improvements in most PROs at week 16 vs PBO, mirroring improvements previously reported with FIL in disease activity measures [1].

In accordance with the results of a multicentre clinical study, REMS T-score values were highly correlated with Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) T-scores [1]. Objectives To determine the predictive value in term of fragility fracture risk reduction of the REMS T-score compared to DXA T-score in a representative female population. Methods We enrolled 1370 women (30-90 y, BMI ? 35 kg/m2) from 2013 to 2017. We performed in all patients both DXA and REMS lumbar scans. All analyses were performed under the strictest adherence to the corresponding guidelines. All patients underwent a follow-up lasting up to 5 years to assess the incidence of fragility fractures. Patients were stratified in two groups: patients who suffered a fragility fracture during the follow-up period (Group X) and those who did not (Group Y). Through an iterative process, the two groups were then age-matched with an enrolment proportion of 1:2. The finally obtained groups were identified as Group A (with incident fractures) and Group B (without incident fractures). The performance of REMS T-score in discriminating between Group A and Group B was quantitatively assessed and compared with DXA. Results Fragility fractures incidence was 14.0% (192 out of 1370 patients, mean follow-up 3.6 ± 0.8 years). Group A included 180 patients (mean age 67.2 ± 7.2 years) and Group B included 360 patients (mean age 67.3 ± 3.5 y). Group A and Group B did not show significant differences with respect to height (p=0.41), weight (p=0.68) and BMI (p=0.32). As expected we found significant differences in REMS T-score (-2.68 ± 1.28 in Group A vs -2.03 ± 1.23 in Group B, p<0.001) and DXA T-score (-2.52 ± 1.20 in Group A vs -2.08 ± 1.17 in Group B, p<0.001). REMS T-score ? -2.5 identified Group A patients with sensitivity = 65% and specificity = 58% (OR=2.6). DXA T-score identified Group A patients with sensitivity = 57% and specificity = 57% (OR=1.7). Conclusion REMS T-score resulted an effective predictor for the risk of incident fragility fractures in a representative population-based sample of female subjects. Reported OR values showed also that REMS had a better performance than DXA in the considered population, showing higher values for both sensitivity and specificity in the identification of fragile patients.

Fractures in GIOP frequently occur with higher bone mineral density (BMD) than expected and typically at treatment initiation, complicating the identification of patients at risk for fracture. Objectives Identify risk factors associated with fragility fracture development in GC-treated patients. Methods 127 patients (aged 62±18years, 63% women, 46% postmenopausal) on GC treatment (prednisone ?5mg/day, >3months) were included. Clinical data collected included: risk factors for OP and fractures, dose and GC-treatment duration, previous fractures and disease activity, anthropometric data, bone metabolism parameters (including gonadal axis study), BMD analysis (DXA; OP: T-score ?-2.5), TBS (degraded microarchitecture [DMA]:<1.230), dorsolumbar X-ray (assessing vertebral fractures [VF]) and FRAX risk (GC-adjusted)1. Results Most patients received GC treatment for vasculitis or polymyalgia rheumatica during 47.7±69 months (mean daily dose: 14.5mg). 17% had VF, 28% had fragility fracture (VF + non-VF), 29% OP and 71% DMA. Patients with VF received more GC-boluses (57.1% vs. 29.5%,p=0.03), were older (68±13 vs. 60±19 years, p=0.02), postmenopausal (100% vs. 67%, p=0.015) and/or men with testosterone <250ng/dL (57% vs. 11%, p=0.017) and had lower TBS values (1.100 vs. 1.220, p<0.001) and higher FRAX risk (17 vs. 9, p=0.003); patients with fragility fractures showed higher accumulated GC-doses (6.1±13 vs. 8±18g, p=0.046). On multivariate analysis, hypogonadism (OR 14.3; IC95% 2.2->100, p=0.01) and having received GC-boluses (OR 3.40; IC95% 1-11.8, p=0.01) were the principal factors associated with VF. Hypogonadism (OR 7.1; IC95% 1.5-38.7, p=0.01) and having a FRAX >20 (OR 6.97; IC95% 1.3-51.7, p=0.02) were factors related to the presence of fragility fractures. Men with testosterone <250ng/dL had higher BMI (29.4 vs. 26.3, p=0.005) and disease activity (ESR 23 vs. 12, p=0.005) and lower TBS (1.050 vs. 1.210, p<0.001); age, daily and cumulated GC doses were similar to subjects with normal testosterone levels. Conclusion Hypogonadism is a major risk factor for developing fractures in GC-treated men and women, whereas receiving GC-boluses is related to VF, indicating the importance of evaluating the gonadal axis in these patients.

However, there is controversial evidence about the association between bariatric surgery and fracture risk. This may be due to the fundamental differences between patients undergoing bariatric surgery with patients who do not, raising the question: within patients who fracture, are they are at increased risk of fracture after surgery? And if so, who is at risk of fracture? Objectives 1. To investigate the association between bariatric surgery and risk of three fracture locations using a within person study design comparing a) the 5 year incidence post surgery to the 5 year pre surgery, b) splitting the 5 year post surgery risk into two windows 0-2 and 2.01 – 5 years. 2. To predict who is at risk of fracture following bariatric surgery. Methods A self-controlled case series analysis (SCCS) and Stepwise logistic regression (LR) were conducted. Patients undergoing bariatric surgery were identified in the clinical practice research datalink (CPRD) GOLD dataset and linked to hospital episode statistics (HES) data. Primary outcome was any fracture (any skeletal sites except skull and digits). Secondary outcomes were major (hip, spine, forearm and humerus) and peripheral fractures (forearm and lower leg). For the SCCS, Poisson models in those who fractured were fit to calculate Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) for the aforementioned time windows. Potential predictors were selected with an exit p-value of 0.157 and their predictive performance was reported using a C-statistic. Results Of 5,492 patients undergoing bariatric surgery, 252 patients had 272 any fractures, 75 (80) major fractures and 126 (135) peripheral fractures. Average BMI was 43.9. Major fracture risk increased nearly threefold following surgery: IRR (95% CI) 2.70 (1.31, 5.57). Conversely, the incidence of any and peripheral fractures did not change: IRRs 1.17 (0.86, 1.60) and 0.92 (0.60, 1.42) respectively. Any and major fracture risk increased in the 3rd to 5th year post-surgery: IRRs of 1.73 (1.08, 2.77), 4.98 (1.94, 12.78) respectively. 7 variables were identified which may predict major fracture with a high c-statistics of 0.77 (0.71, 0.88). Conclusion Few patients had fractures (252/5492). The incidence of major osteoporotic fracture is increased after bariatric surgery by nearly 3 fold, to then increase to 5 fold in the 2-5 year window. Multiple factors were identified for patients at risk of major fracture post-operatively. External validation is needed. Further research is needed on post-bariatric surgery care to minimise fracture risk.

REMS (Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry) is a non-ionizing instrument used to quantitatively evaluate bone mineral density at lumbar spine and femoral neck sites [1]. Objectives To assess the accuracy of REMS in osteoporosis diagnosis at axial sites (lumbar spine and hip) compared with the gold standard, Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Methods We enrolled patients aged from 50 to 75 years and perfomed a total of 1,699 and 1,794 lumbar spine and proximal femur scans with REMS and DXA. A quality checks on DXA and REMS acquired data were performed through direct examination of scans by experienced operators. We investigated the agreement between the two techniques calculating: Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), Standard Error of the Estimate (SEE) and efficiency (sensitivity and specificity) in identifying osteoporotic individuals (i.e. T-score ? -2.5). Results We found a good linear correlation between REMS and DXA BMD estimation, Pearson coefficient r=0.938 for lumbar spine and r=0.933 for proximal femur (p<0.001 for both). SEE values were 5.2% and 5.8% for lumbar spine and femoral site, respectively. In addition, REMS demonstrated a high sensitivity (92.9% and 92.3% for spine and femur) and specificity (93.5% for spine and 92.6% for femur) for the discrimination of osteoporotic patient. Moreover, considering together all the diagnostic classification categories (healthy, osteopenia and osteoporosis), the diagnostic agreement between REMS and DXA was 90.2% and 89.3% for lumbar spine and proximal femur sites, respectively. Conclusion REMS exhibited a high sensitivity and specificity in identifying osteoporotic patients at lumbar spine or proximal femur sites compared with gold-standard DXA. REMS accurately diagnosed osteoporotic patients in clinical routine, at both lumbar spine and proximal femur sites, without using ionizing radiation.

JOUR,FRI0573?Ultrasonography and histological diagnosis concordance in patiens with suspected primary sjÖgren syndrome,"['Barrio Nogal, L.', 'Bohórquez, C.', 'Perez Gómez, A.', 'Castelló, A.', 'León, M.J.', 'Pretel, P.', 'Álvarez de Mon, M.']",2018,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2018-eular.6181,"Background Minor salivary gland biopsy (MSGB) is the most used diagnostic tool for primary Sjögren Syndrome (SS). The potential relevance of an alternative non-invasive, fast, low cost and choice by the patient technique, like mayor salivary gland ultrasonography (MSGUS), has to be investigated. Objectives To evaluate the utility of MSGUS as a diagnostic tool for primary SS and to study the concordance with MSBG. Methods 36 patients were consecutively recruited with clinical and/or analytical suspicion of SS, from outpatient Rheumatology consultations from 2015–2017. All patients received a MSGB and a MSGUS. Two echographers performed two images readings with an interval of at least one week. They worked blinded for clinical and histological results. Demographics, clinical, serological, ESSPRI and ESDAI were recorded. The histological results were classified according to Chisholm and Mason score and the US results according to the system by Cornec et al. The final SS diagnosis was made using the 2002 classification criteria. Subsequently the data was analysed using the statistical software STATA/MP. Adjusted concordance intra and interobserver (kappa coefficient) was calculated for the diagnoses performed by US (normal/pathological). The validity of US and biopsy to diagnose SS according to the 2002 criteria was evaluated by calculating the percent agreement between the tests, along with the specificity, sensitivity, PPV, NPV and area below the curve (AUC). Further, the percent association of the diagnoses between serology and US were determined, and the statistical significance of it was evaluated with chi-square test. Results 94% were female, with an average age of 58 years. 69% were non-smokers. 89% showed pathological Shirmer test, 78% extraglandular features, 19% hypocomplemetemia and 44% hypergammaglobulinemia. As for the serological data, 81% had positive ANAS, 44% antiRo52, 39% antiRo60% and 28% antiLa. 39% of the patients were RF positive. 69% fulfilled the 2002 classification criteria with an average ESSPRI of 5.3 and ESSDAI of 1.5. Using these criteria as a gold-standard, the total percentage agreement was 83.3% for US and 80.6% for biopsy (S 92, Sp 64.3%). A good concordance was found between both observers (kappa=0.8) along with intraobserver (kappa=0.64 and 0.78 for first and second observer respectively). The percentage of patients with positive antibodies (48% antiRo52, 41% antiRo60, 30% antiLa) had pathological US. Significant statistical differences were not found in patients with normal US (p>0.44 in all associations explored). Conclusions MSGUS is a non-invasive imaging method useful for the diagnosis of primary SS in common clinical practice with a diagnostic value similar to the MSGB. MSGUS has good correlation intra and interobserver. There was no statistical significant association found between the positive autoimmune antibodies and US.

JOUR,Imaging in osteogenesis imperfecta: Where we are and where we are going,"['Gazzotti, S.', 'Sassi, R.', 'Aparisi Gómez, M.P.', 'Moroni, A.', 'Brizola, E.', 'Miceli, M.', 'Bazzocchi, A.']",2024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmg.2024.104926,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited skeletal dysplasias. The hallmark features of OI include bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures, bone deformity, and diminished growth, along with a plethora of associated secondary features (both skeletal and extraskeletal). The diagnosis of OI is currently made on clinical grounds and may be confirmed by genetic testing. However, imaging remains pivotal in the evaluation of this disease. The aim of this article is to review the current role played by the various radiologic techniques in the diagnosis and monitoring of OI in the postnatal setting as well as to discuss recent advances and future perspectives in OI imaging. Conventional Radiography and Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) are currently the two most used imaging modalities in OI. The cardinal radiographic features of OI include generalized osteopenia/osteoporosis, bone deformities, and fractures. DXA is currently the most available technique to assess Bone Mineral Density (BMD), specifically areal BMD (aBMD). However, DXA has important limitations and cannot fully characterize bone fragility in OI based on aBMD. Novel DXA-derived parameters, such as Trabecular Bone Score (TBS), may provide further insight into skeletal changes induced by OI, but evidence is still limited. Techniques like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can be useful as problem-solvers or in specific settings, including the evaluation of cranio-cervical abnormalities. Recent evidence supports the use of High-Resolution peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) as a promising tool to improve the characterization of bone fragility in OI. However, HR-pQCT remains a primarily research technique at present. Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) is an alternative to DXA for the determination of BMD at central sites, with distinct advantages but considerably higher radiation exposure. Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) is a portable, inexpensive, and radiation-free modality that may complement DXA evaluation, providing information on bone quality. However, evidence of usefulness of QUS in OI is poor. Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS) is an emerging non-ionizing imaging method that holds promise for the diagnosis of low BMD and for the prediction of fracture risk, but so far only one published study has investigated its role in OI. To conclude, several different radiologic techniques have proven to be effective in the diagnosis and monitoring of OI, each with their own specificities and peculiarities. Clinicians should be aware of the strategic role of the various modalities in the different phases of the patient care process. In this scenario, the development of international guidelines including recommendations on the role of imaging in the diagnosis and monitoring of OI, accompanied by continuous active research in the field, could significantly improve the standardization of patient care."
JOUR,Nuevos métodos de evaluación de la densidad y contenido mineral óseo,"['García, José Canessa']",2025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmclc.2025.08.001,"Resumen Se discuten las nuevas técnicas disponibles para complementar la evaluación de la densidad ósea convencional (DMO) efectuada con densitometría ósea radiológica (DXA), y orientadas a evaluar la calidad ósea y estimar el riego de fractura osteoporótica, permitiendo una mejor estimación clínica de la salud ósea, la instalación precoz y selectiva de terapia dirigida y controlar su evolución. Complementarias a un estudio DXA convencional, y plenamente validadas, se dispone de herramientas de estimación de riesgo de fractura a 10 años, tomando en cuenta los factores de riesgo más conocidos (FRAX) y el análisis de textura trabecular (TBS). El análisis geométrico estructural de cadera (HSA) aunque disponible, no está aún validado clínicamente. Aparte de DXA, cuyas limitaciones son, entre otras, que entregan una dosis de radiación ionizante (muy baja), analizan un área de hueso más que un volumen y que no diferencian entre hueso cortical y trabecular, se encuentran las imágenes radiológicas cuantitativas, como tomografía computada (QCT) y tomografía computada periférica de alta resolución (HR-pQCT) que también irradian al paciente (dosis mayores). Las técnicas sin radiación como ultrasonido cuantitativo (QUS), radiofrecuencia por ultrasonido (REMS) y resonancia magnética cuantitativa (QMRI), en mayor o menor medida aportan un análisis tridimensional o volumétrico, de alta resolución, permitiendo diferenciar entre hueso cortical y trabecular y aumentando la especificidad del diagnóstico. La principal limitación de estas nuevas tecnologías es su alto costo, poca disponibilidad y, en algunos casos, falta de validación clínica en grandes poblaciones. La incorporación de inteligencia artificial a estas técnicas revolucionará el análisis e interpretación de imágenes y la automatización de procesos. New techniques are discussed to complement the conventional assessment of bone mineral density (BMD) performed using radiological bone densitometry (DXA), with the aim of evaluating bone quality and estimating the risk of osteoporotic fracture. These approaches allow for a more accurate clinical assessment of bone health, early and selective initiation of targeted therapy, and monitorization of its progression. Complementary to standard DXA studies and fully validated, the 10-year fracture risk estimation tool (FRAX), which incorporates well-established clinical risk factors, and the trabecular bone score (TBS), derived from texture analysis, are available. Hip structural analysis (HSA), although available, has not yet been clinically validated. Beyond DXA, which has limitations such as exposure to ionizing radiation (albeit very low), the analysis of bone area rather than volume, and the inability to differentiate cortical from trabecular bone, other imaging modalities include quantitative radiological techniques such as quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT), which also involve radiation exposure (with higher doses). Radiaton-free techniques like quantitative ultrasound (QUS), radiofrequency echographic multi-spectrometry (REMS), and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (QMRI) are also available. These latter methods, to varying extents, provide three-dimensional or volumetric assessments, high-resolution imaging, and the ability to distinguish between cortical and trabecular bone, thereby increasing diagnostic specificity. The main limitations of these newer technologies include their high cost, limited availability, and, in some cases, a lack of clinical validation in large population studies. The integration of artificial intelligence into these techniques is expected to revolutionize image analysis and interpretation, as well as the automation of diagnostic processes."

Standard dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measuring bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck and lumbar spine (central sites) has suboptimal sensitivity in predicting fracture risk in the general population. An association between sarcopenia and osteoporosis in PD has not been studied. We compared BMD and osteoporosis prevalence in PD patients vs controls; determined the osteoporosis detection rates using central alone vs central plus distal radius DXA; and analyzed factors (in particular, sarcopenia) associated with osteoporosis. One hundred and fifty-six subjects (102 patients with PD, 54 spousal/sibling controls) underwent femoral neck-lumbar spine-distal radius DXA. Seventy-three patients and 46 controls were assessed for sarcopenia using whole-body DXA and handgrip strength. Patients underwent clinical and serum biochemical evaluations. PD patients had significantly lower body mass index compared to controls. After adjustment for possible confounders, distal radius BMD and T-scores were significantly lower in PD patients compared to controls, but not at the femoral neck/lumbar spine. With distal radius DXA, an additional 11.0% of patients were diagnosed with osteoporosis (32.0% to 43.0%), vs 3.7% in controls (33.3% to 37.0%) additionally diagnosed; this increase was largely driven by the markedly higher detection rate in female PD patients. Female gender (adjusted odds ratio [ORadjusted]?=?11.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6–48.6) and sarcopenia (ORadjusted?=?8.4, 95% CI: 1.1–64.9) were independent predictors for osteoporosis in PD. Distal radius DXA increased osteoporosis detection, especially in female PD patients, suggesting that diagnostic protocols for osteoporosis in PD could be optimized. A close association between osteoporosis and sarcopenia was documented for the first time in PD, which has important implications for clinical management and future research."

Previous studies estimated that approximately one-third of the RA patients had osteoporosis (OP). However, most fragility fractures occur in patients not suffering from OP, that can be partly explained by impaired quality of bone, which is not measured with DXA. Therefore, only the measurement of bone mineral density is not sufficient to determine the indication for OP treatment. Another tool for assessing the need for anti-osteoporotic therapy is to calculate the 10-year probability of a major fracture using the fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX). Objectives: To assess the need for anti-osteoporotic therapy in women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) based on the identification of individuals with fragility fractures and high risk of fracture according to FRAX. Methods: 295 postmenopausal women with RA were included in the study. The average age was 63±7 years, the duration of RA was 11 [4;16] years, the duration of postmenopausal period was 13 [6; 20] years. 121 (41%) patients took glucocorticoids (cumulative dose 9025 [3650; 20720] mg in prednisolone equivalent). A survey was conducted to identify patients with risk factors and a history of fragility fractures. The 10-year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture was assessed using the FRAX tool. In patients treated with glucocorticoids at a dose >7.5 mg in prednisolone equivalent the estimates of probabilities of a major osteoporotic fracture were adjusted in accordance with the recommendations [1]. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the proximal femur was performed in patients with a moderate risk (probabilities between the upper and lower assessment age-dependent intervention threshold) and the risk of fracture was recalculated with including femoral neck BMD. Results: 83 (28.1%) patients had a prior fragility fracture: 44 (14,9%) – 1, 20 (6,8%) – 2 and 19 (6.4%) – 3 or more. Vertebral fractures were the most common, they accounted for 62,1% of all fractures, distal forearm was the second frequent fractures localization (18.2%). Only 2 (0.7%) women had hip fracture. The average 10-year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture was 17 % [11; 28] in RA women. 92 (31.2%) persons were at high risk, 28 (9.5%) patients - at low risk, and 175 (59.3%) - at moderate risk. After recalculation of fracture risk with including femoral neck BMD in people at moderate risk 48 (16.3 %) patients became at high risk, 9 (3.1%) – at very high risk, and 118 (40.0%) - at low risk. Thus, 149 (50.5%) RA patients were at very high or high risk and 146 (49,5%) – at low risk of major osteoporotic fracture according to FRAX, among the last – only 3 persons had a history of fragility fracture after age of 40 years. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that a half of postmenopausal women with RA had indications for anti-osteoporotic treatment based on the results of a 10-year probability of major fragility fractures using FRAX tool.

However, the precise effects on cortical and trabecular bone are not fully clarified. Objectives: To investigate the effect of romosozumab on three-dimensional QTC-like parameters of cortical and trabecular compartments of the proximal femur. Table 1. Methods: We conducted a 6-monhts prospective observational study on postmenopausal women treated with romosozumab. Image files of the hip DXA scans at baseline and after 6 months of romosozumab were transferred for DXA-based 3D modeling (3D-SHAPER v2.10.1, Galgo Medical, Spain). In brief, the software built a QCT-like 3D proximal femur model for each DXA image, based on a database of QCT scans from a reference population. Integral, cortical and trabecular vBMD (mg/cm3) were extracted. Other 3D-DXA measurements included: Cortical surface sBMD (mg/cm2), cortical BMC (g), cortical and trabular volume (cm3), cortical Thickness (mm), cross-sectional area (CSA, cm2) and cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI, cm4). Results: 19 post-menopausal women were included in the study. The increase in aBMD were paralleled by a significant increase in most trabecular parameters but not cortical parameters. Figure 1 shows the 6-month % increase in 3D-DXA parameters and p-values adjusted with Holm-Šídák method. In synthesis (list not complete – see Table 1 for absolute variations and Figure 1 for % variations in X axis the % increase in the parameter and in Y axis the -log10 of the p value, the higher the more significant change): Trabecular vBMD Total (mg/cm3) increased from 74.82 to 83.56 (SE of difference 3,43, p 0.02), integral vBMD Total (mg/cm3) increased from 194.7 to 204.4 (SE of difference 3.79, p 0.02), CSA InterTroch (cm2) increased from 0.97 to 1.03 (SE of difference 0,02, p 0.01) and CSMI InterTroch (cm4) increased from 3.46 to 3.68 (SE of difference 0.09, p 0.02).

Radiofrequency Echographic Multi-Spectrometry (REMS) is a novel technique already validated in assessing Bone Mineral Density (BMD) in post-menopausal osteoporosis [2]. It is characterized by its agile machinery and the absence of ionizing radiation. Additionally, REMS is robust against artifacts, which are known to affect Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA), especially at the lumbar spine (LS) - including aortic calcifications and osteophytes [3]. Objectives: The aim of this real-life, cross-sectional, explorative study was to compare REMS with DXA in assessing BMD in patients affected by axSpA. Methods: LS and femur scans were acquired using both techniques, including LS latero-lateral (LL) DXA scans. ANOVA for repeated measures was utilized to compare the differences in T-scores among DXA anteroposterior (AP), LL, and REMS scans at the LS, as well as between DXA and REMS T-scores at the total hip (TH) and femoral neck (FN). The correlation between the T-scores at the hip site was assessed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results: A total of 55 patients were enrolled (see Table 1). No significant differences were found between the BMD T-scores measured through DXA or REMS at the femur. At the lumbar spine, the DXA AP mean T-score was significantly higher than those obtained through LL DXA and REMS (Figure 1). A strong positive correlation was observed between the T-scores obtained with the two techniques, both at the TH (r=0.80, p <0.01) and FN (r=0.77, p <0.01). Conclusion: Our findings indicate a notable concordance between DXA and REMS in assessing T-scores at the femoral sites in SpA patients. Particularly at the LS, REMS may offer more precise BMD measurements in this distinct patient group, where DXA assessments are potentially confounded by the presence of syndesmophytes REFERENCES: [1] Yan F, Wu L, Lang J, Huang Z (2024) Bone density and fracture risk factors in ankylosing spondylitis: a meta-analysis.

However, FRAX has several limitations in assessing the risk of fracture in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In 2013 V.A. Nasonova Reasearch Institute of Rheumatology (Russia) developed a predictive mathematical model for assessing the risk of osteoporotic fractures in RA, which includes 2 main risk factors: cumulative glucocorticoid dose (GC), decrease in BMD in the femoral neck to osteoporosis, and 2 additional factors: for patients under 65 years of age - the presence of ischemic heart disease, and for people over 65 - a history of gastric ulcer or duodenal ulcer. Objectives: To compare accuracy of osteoporotic fracture risk prediction in patients with RA using the predictive model developed at V.A. Nasonova Reasearch Institute of Rheumatology (IR) and FRAX. Methods: This monocentric (single-center) prospective study included 70 patients with RA, aged 40 to 80 years. The follow-up period - 8.0 ± 1.2 years; mean age at the baseline was 55.4±7.8 years old; the mean disease duration at the baseline - 14,7±10,2 years. All patients retrospectively calculated the 10-year probability of fractures and prognostic model developed by the IR. Results: According to the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool, 32 (46%) patients had a low risk of osteoporotic fractures, 38 (54%) had a high risk. According to the predictive model of IR 33 (47%) patients had a low risk of osteoporotic fractures, 37 (53%) had a high risk. During the follow-up period, osteoporotic fractures were occurred in 18 (26%) patients: 14 (78%) of them had a high risk of fractures according to the predictive IR model, and 13 (72%) patients - according to the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool. Positive and negative predictive value of the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool was 34% and 84%, respectively, of the predictive model of IR - 38% and 88%, respectively. Prognosis of the predictive model of IR in 73% cases coincided with assessing the 10-year probability of fracture. Conclusion: The predictive model developed at V.A. Nasonova Reasearch Institute of Rheumatology (Russia) showed a higher sensitivity and specificity in determining the risk of osteoporotic fractures in RA patients vs FRAX algorithm.

JOUR,POS1109?MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF RISK FACTORS FOR REDUCED BONE MINERAL DENSITY ASSESSED WITH RADIOFREQUENCY ECHOGRAPHIC MULTI SPECTROMETRY (REMS),"['Batalov, Z.', 'Nikolov, M.', 'Nikolov, N.']",2021,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.1768,"Background: Radiofrequency echographic multi spectrometry (REMS) is an innovative radiation-free approach for the assessment of bone mineral density (BMD) at axial sites. The principle of this technology is based on the analysis of native raw unfiltered ultrasound signals, the so called radiofrequency ultrasound signals, acquired during an echographic scan of the lumbar spine and/or femoral neck. [1]. A previous published study showed a high degree of correlation between the T-score values provided by the two techniques-REMS and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry for both lumbar spine and femoral neck [2]. REMS software outputs information about BMD (g/cm2), T-scores, Z-scores [standard deviations (SD)], percentage of body fat and basal metabolic rate [BMR (kcal/daily)] [3]. Objectives: The aim of the current study is to investigate the multivariate significant risk factors for reduced BMD through REMS technology. Methods: In this study, a total of 273 women with mean age 62 years (yrs.) ± 12 yrs. (range 25-88 yrs.) underwent REMS assessments. Subjects were divided into two groups after acquiring information about the spinal T-scores: 1st group with T-scores ?-1 SD and 2nd group with T-scores <-1 SD. Age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), basal metabolic rate (BMR), body fat and menopausal status were the risk factors included in the multivariate statistical analyses. Binary logistic regression was used to assess which are the significant risk factors for T-score <-1 SD. Youden's indices were calculated for selecting the cut-off points for each risk factor. Results: 273 women had mean weight of 70.5 kg. ± 15.7 kg. (range 39.4-127 kg.), mean height 157.1 cm. ± 8.8 cm. (range 100-182 cm.) and mean body mass index (BMI) 28.6 kg/cm2 ± 6.1 kg/cm2 (range 14.9-47.5 kg/cm2). The mean body fat of the subjects was 37.8% ± 8.8% (range 9-52%) and the mean BMR was 1274.01 kcal/daily ± 163.17 kcal/daily (range 929.7-1908.4 kcal/daily). 260 women (95.2%) were attributed to postmenopausal. Age (p=0.000), BMI (p=0.015), menopause (p=0.006) and BMR (p=0.000) were the multivariate significant risk factors for T-score <-1 SD. Odds ratio for the risk factor age was 1.16, so each added year of the women's age increased the risk for T-score <-1 SD by 1.16%. Women over the age of 65 yrs. showed the highest risk for spinal T-score <-1 SD. The odds ratio of the menopause as a risk factor for spinal T-score <-1 SD was 9.54, so postmenopausal women showed about 9.5 times higher risk of T-score <-1 SD of the lumbar spine than women who still have their period. The increase of BMI by one kg/cm2 decreased the probability of spinal T-score <-1 SD by 0.15% and the increase of BMR by one kcal/daily decreased this probability by 0.02%. Women with BMI above 28.63 kg/cm2 and those with BMR >1331.75 kcal/daily were unlikely to develop spinal T-score <-1 SD. Conclusion: In the current study, multivariate regression analysis was used to develop a specific REMS-based risk prediction model for spinal BMD, corresponding to T-score <-1 SD. Postmenopausal women over age of 65 yrs. with BMI lower than 28.63 kg/cm2 and BMR <1331.75 kcal/daily were at the highest risk for T-score <-1 SD of the lumbar spine.

Yet, the assessment of vertebral fracture (VF) status has not become standard practice. Objectives: Our study aimed to evaluate the reliability of VFA as assessed by a rheumatologist and a radiology technician. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study assessing the performance of low-radiation single energy x-ray absorptiometry VFA for the detection of VF. We selected patients who were assessed for osteoporosis according to screening protocols. Bone mineral densitometry was measured using standard methods over the lumbar spine L1-L4, the total proximal femur, and results were expressed as T-scores. All VFA were independently evaluated by 2 experienced readers: a rheumatologist and a radiology technician for the identification of VF (T4-L4). VF was classified according to the Genant grading system: grade 1 for an anterior, mid or posterior reduction of 20–25% in vertebral height; grade 2 for a reduction of 25– 40% and grade 3 for a reduction of more than 40% in vertebral height. A score for the inter-rater reliability between the readers was expressed using the kappa statistic. Results: One hundred patients were included with a mean age of 66.9 ± 9.5 years [46.7-83] years. There was a female predominance (91%). Nearly half of patients had osteopenia (48.9%), 27.7% had osteoporosis and 23.4% had a normal bone mineral density. On VFA scans, the non-visible vertebra was mostly located in the upper thoracic spine (60%). The mean number of VF was 1.2 [0-3] for both readers. According to the doctor's evaluation, 25% of patients had at least one VF, of which 75.9% had a Genant grade 1, 17.2% had a Genant 2, and 6.9% had a VF grade 3. According to the technician evaluation, at least one VF was found in 36% of patients. A grade 1 was assessed in 91.7% of cases, a grade 2 in 8.3% of patients but no VF grade 3 was assessed. A kappa score for the inter-rater reliability between the readers for VFA was 0.545 (p=0.000). The overall agreement by grade between the readers was 0.785 (p=0,000). The exclusion of non-visible vertebra resulted in a better agreement (k=0.853). Further analysis excluding vertebra T4 to D10, revealed a very good agreement (k=0.9). Conclusion: Our study showed a low agreement between the readers on VFA and a better agreement when non-visible vertebrae were excluded. Thus, caution should be advocated when relying exclusively on this device. Disclosure of Interests: None declared."

Objectives: The aim of this multicenter observational study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of REMS with respect to DXA in patients with different body mass index (BMI) categories. Methods: The inclusion criteria were: Caucasian women; age between 30 and 90 years; referral by their clinician for spinal DXA assessment; absence of significant walking impairment; signed informed consent. Patients underwent DXA and REMS scans at the lumbar spine, according to the procedures described in Di Paola et al. [1], including an a-posteriori quality check of the examinations in order to guarantee the maximum reliability of the diagnostic outputs. Three groups of patients were considered according to BMI:: underweight (BMI<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (BMI?18.5 kg/m2 and <25 kg/m2), and overweight/obese (BMI?25 kg/m2). DXA and REMS BMD values were also stratified in 3 diagnostic categories: osteoporotic, osteopenic, or healthy. The degree of correlation between DXA and REMS BMD values was quantified by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). The diagnostic concordance between REMS and DXA was assessed by Cohen's K considering the 3 diagnostic categories. REMS´s sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for discriminating patients with and without osteoporosis were also calculated using DXA outcomes as reference. The same statistics were calculated accepting a 0.3 T-score tolerance on T-score values of borderline cases [1]. Results: Overall, 4282 patients were enrolled and, after the quality check, 3501 couples of scans were included in the analyses. Of these patients, 122 (3.5%) were underweight, 1964 (56.1%) were normal weight, and 1415 (40.4%) were overweight. The results of the diagnostic performance in patients after BMI stratification are reported in Table 1. Conclusion: We observed an excellent correlation between REMS-based diagnosis with respect to the osteoporosis diagnosis performed by DXA in patients from each BMI category. These results indicate that lumbar spine REMS analysis is a suitable and accurate diagnostic tool for patients with different BMI. References: [1]Di Paola M et al.

It has already been validated in Italian women with respect to the current clinical reference technology, Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). Purpose Aim of the current study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of REMS technology with respect to DXA in a wider European clinical context. Methods A total of 4307 female Caucasian patients aged between 30 and 90 years underwent DXA and REMS scans at femoral neck and/or lumbar spine (the site depending on the medical prescription). The acquired data underwent a rigorous quality check in order to exclude the erroneous DXA and REMS reports. The diagnostic agreement between the two technologies was assessed, also stratifying for patients' age groups. The ability to recognise previously fractured patients was also investigated. Results Overall, 4245 lumbar spine scans and 4271 femoral neck scans were performed. The ability to discriminate patients with and without osteoporosis by femoral neck investigation resulted in sensitivity and specificity of 90.4% and 95.5%, respectively. For lumbar spine scans, a sensitivity of 90.9% and a specificity of 95.1% were obtained. The areas under the curve (AUCs) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve evaluating the ability to discriminate groups of patients with previous osteoporotic fracture using DXA and REMS T-score values were 0.631 and 0.683 (p < 0.0001), respectively, for femoral neck scans, whereas 0.603 and 0.640 (p = 0.0002), respectively, for lumbar spine scans.

Objectives The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the REMS BMD assessment with dual-energy X-rays absorptiometry (DXA) in a cohort of patients affected by end-stage renal disease undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Methods Consecutive patients referring to the PD clinic of our hospital were enrolled. Lumbar spine and proximal femur REMS scans were performed, and lumbar spine (anteroposterior and laterolateral) and proximal femur DXA scans were performed as well. Clinical data were extracted from medical records. The risk assessment outputs of two fracture risk algorithms (FRAXÂ® and DeFRAÂ®), calculated upon the worst BMD obtained from either technique were compared as well. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc analysis (Bonferroni) and a two-sided Student's t-test were used to estimate the absolute differences between groups. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants included (protocol 1483 CESC). Results 41 total patients were enrolled (table 1). No significant differences were documented between the BMD T-scores measured through DXA or REMS at the proximal femur. At the lumbar spine, the DXA laterolateral T-score was not significantly different from that of REMS, while the DXA anteroposterior T-score was significantly higher than both the anteroposterior DXA and the REMS measurements (figure 1). When either DXA or REMS was adopted, no significant difference in the fracture risk estimate was found for both algorithms (figure 2). Conclusions Our data showed a good agreement, in a real-life PD setting, between the DXA and REMS-derived BMDs and in the consequent fracture risk assessment obtained with the FRAXÂ® or DeFRAÂ® tools."

However, the use of REMS for bone densitometry in patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities (SMID) remains to be reported. This study aimed to investigate whether REMS technology can be used for densitometric evaluation of osteoporosis in patients with SMID with hip dislocation and severe scoliosis. Methods Sixty-five patients with SMID, who resided in a long-term care facility and received comprehensive medical and rehabilitation care, underwent REMS scans of the femoral neck and/or lumbar spine. Data regarding anthropometric parameters (height and weight), bone mineral density (BMD), clinical diagnostic classification, physical ability, presence of scoliosis and hip dislocation, and frontal radiographs of both hip joints were obtained. Results We included 29 men and 34 women (mean age: 52.6 years). All patients underwent successful scanning at either the femoral neck (82.5 %) or lumbar spine (95.2 %). BMD measurements obtained using REMS revealed low values, with a mean BMD, T-score, and Z-score of 0.67 g/cm2, ?2.39 standard deviation (SD), and ? 1.38 SD, respectively, at the femoral neck and 0.66 g/cm2, ?2.70 SD, and ? 1.87 SD, respectively, at the lumbar spine. The average Cobb angle of the lumbar spine was 34.0°; furthermore, dislocation rates did not significantly differ between those with and without successful BMD measurements (p = 0.073). Lumbar BMD T-scores were significantly correlated with femoral neck BMD T-scores (p < 0.001, r = 0.530). Conclusion All patients with SMID were able to undergo measurements of either spinal or femoral neck BMD; furthermore, 77.7 % of the patients underwent measurements at both the lumbar spine and femur.

And although it is a novel therapeutic agent for osteoporosis, which has shown high effects of increasing bone density and inhibiting fragile fracture in overseas clinical trials. However the clinical efficacy in daily clinical practice is unknown. Objectives: To evaluate the early clinical efficacy of ROM in patients with osteoporosis between rheumatoid arthritis (RA-OP) and primary osteoporosis (P-OP) for 6 months. Methods: RA patients diagnosed according to the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria. RA-OP and P-OP patients met at least one of the following criteria were eligible; a bone mineral density T score of -2,5 or less at the lumber spine or total hip and either one or more moderate or severe vertebral fractures or two or more mild vertebral fractures. All patients were initiated ROM from between March and June, 2019. The total number of patients was 15 cases, including 8 RA-OP and 7 P-OP. All patients received continuous ROM therapy more than 6 months. The DMB dose was 210mg at once every 1 months. In all cases native or activated vitamin D has been used. We reviewed the results for 6 months about the increase and decrease of bone mineral density (BMD) of lumbar spine(LS) and total hip(TH) by DEXA and bone turnover markers, intact n-terminal propeptide type I procollagen(PINP) and tartrate-resistant acid phopshatate form 5b(TRACP-5b). Results: The gender was all female. The mean age was 71.8 ± 8.7; disease duration of RA-OP patients was 23.0 ± 15.1 years; the body mass index was 19.9 ± 3.2 and the FRAX was 32.5 ± 14.9. Clinical findings related to RA-OP at baseline were as follows; CRP 0.97 ± 0.77; DAS-CRP 3.22 ± 0.41; HAQ 1.41 ± 0.94 in RA-OP patients and in the all patients, bone turnover markers and bone mineral density at baseline were as follows; P1NP 72.2 ± 39.8; TRACP-5b 539 ± 212; LS-BMD and T-score 0.80 ± 0.20 g/cm2 and -2.75 ± 1.36 and TH-BMD 0.55 ± 0.07 g/cm2 and -3.18 ± 0.55 g/cm2. The rate of increased P1NP from baseline to 1, 3 and 6 months were each -96.8 ± 80.8% at 1 month, 106.8 ± 115.6% at 3 month and 90.7 ± 115.7% at 6 month and decreased TRAC-5b were -20.4 ± 20.6% at 1 month, -80.8 ± 19.6% at 3 month and -1.8 ± 50.8% at 6 month. The rate of increased LS-BMD from baseline to 6 months were 11.0 ± 8.0% and TH-BMD were 5.3 ± 3.8% (Fig. 1, 2). Conclusion: Early clinical efficacy of ROM for RA-OP and P-OP was extremely effective and has the high potential to be an important option in the treatment of osteoporosis.

Available scientific evidences describe BMD estimated by REMS as an accurate parameter for the diagnosis of osteoporosis [1]. Objectives: To investigate the effectiveness of the T-score values provided by REMS scans at FN and LS in the identification of frail patients at risk for osteoporotic fractures and to compare the performance of REMS with the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) one. Methods: The patients underwent DXA and REMS scans at FN and at LS. Five clusters of fractures occurred during a median 3.5-year follow-up were identified whether involving the upper limb (forearm, elbow, humerus, wrist, hand), lower limb (tibia, ankle, metatarsus), thorax (shoulder blade, shoulder, rib), hip (femur or pelvis bones), or vertebrae. The ability of REMS and DXA T-score values to assess the incidence and site of fractures was evaluated through an analysis of covariance. Results: Seven hundred twenty-one Caucasian women were enrolled. Ninety-five fractures occurred, in particular 41 at upper limb, 16 at hip, 15 at thorax, 14 at lower limb, 9 at vertebrae. Patients characteristics are reported in table. Considering subcategories of fractured patients, there were not statistically significant differences for age, height, weight and BMI. In the analysis of covariance including age and BMI as covariates, the difference of T-score values between fractured and non-fractured patients is statistically significant for REMS and DXA at both sites. Lower FN T-score values were found for patients with fractures at hip or vertebra with respect to non-fractured patients both for REMS and DXA (p<0.001). Considering LS T-score, lower values were found for patients with fractures at hip, vertebra or upper limb with respect to non-fractured patients both for REMS and DXA (p<0.001, Figure). Conclusion: REMS T-score measured at axial sites is an effective parameter for identification of patients at the risk of incident fragility fractures, in particular occurring at hip, vertebra or upper limb in a population-based sample of female subjects.

Objectives: The exact real-life prevalence of treatment with anti-osteoporotic drugs in women with drug-induced osteoporosis is not known. In the present study, using a new mathematical and computerized algorithm, we investigate the profile of risk of fracture of women with drug-induced osteoporosis and the prevalence of treatment with anti-osteoporotic drugs. Methods: We have retrospectively analyzed the 10-year risk of major osteoporotic fracture calculated with the DeFRAcalc79 tool in postmenopausal women aged over 50 years that were initiating an anti-osteoporotic treatment (fully reimbursed according to the Nota 79). DeFRAcalc79 is a new web-based fracture risk-assessment tool (https://defra-osteoporosi.it) that arithmetically adjusts the risk based on multiple risk factors contemplated by the Nota 79, which regulates the reimbursability for osteoporosis medications in Italy (Italian Agency for Drugs, AIFA), including demographic and anthropometric data, femoral and/or lumbar spine BMD T-score, family history of femoral or vertebral fractures, number and site of previous osteoporotic fracture (including vertebral, femoral, and non-vertebral non-femoral fractures), glucocorticoid treatment (> 3 or > 12 months, ?5 mg prednisone or equivalent), adjuvant hormone therapy for breast cancer, and comorbidities that induce an increased risk of fracture (rheumatoid arthritis and other connective tissue diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, diabetes, or severe physical handicap). This is a sub-analysis of the cross-sectional observational study to validate and further develop the DeFRA algorithm for the estimation of the risk of osteoporotic fractures, promoted by Verona hospital with the unconditional support of Amgen Srl. Results: Among 208 women, 116 (55.8%) were treated with adjuvant hormone therapy for breast cancer and 92 (44.2%) were on glucocorticoid ?5 mg/day. Women on glucocorticoids had a greater mean 10-year risk of fracture compared to women on adjuvant hormone therapy for breast cancer (67.0% vs 39.1% p<0.01). 50.7% of women on adjuvant hormone therapy for breast cancer used denosumab, 28.0% zoledronic acid and 17.3% alendronate. In glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, 17.6% of the women used teriparatide, 37.3% alendronate, 29.4% zoledronic acid and 13.7% denosumab. Conclusion: In our cohort of patients, treatment with adjuvant hormone therapy for breast cancer was slightly more common than glucocorticoids. Women with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis had a greater risk of fracture compared to patients treated with adjuvant hormone therapy for breast cancer. Half of the patients on adjuvant hormone therapy for breast cancer were prescribed with denosumab. One-fifth of the patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis was treated with teriparatide. DeFRAcalc79 is a useful and practical tool for the integrated evaluation of fracture risk in drug-induced osteoporosis.

Objectives: To examine the association of the genotype on a single nucleotide polymorphism on FTO with bone health. Methods: FTO rs1421085 polymorphism was genotyped in 1,601 community-dwelling Japanese participants. This cross-sectional study was nested in Nagasaki Islands Study, which is a prospective cohort in Goto City, in islands of Japan. Participants were recruited at medical check-ups for community dwelling population. Bone mass of the calcaneus was evaluated with stiffness index calculated using a quantitative ultrasound measurement. Low bone mass was defined as a stiffness index less than 80 % of the young adult mean. Sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained. The SNP of rs1421085 was genotyped using hydrolysis probe. The chi-squared test was used to determine whether the variants were in equilibrium in that population. Trend for the median of BMI among genotypes was assessed using the Jonckheere-Terpstra test. Potential associations between FTO polymorphism and overweight and between the polymorphism and low bone mass were evaluated using logistic regression. All analyses were carried out using SPSS 23. Results: Genotype and allele frequencies for the polymorphism were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (minor allele frequency 0.16, p = 0.40) in 1,601 community-dwelling persons (mean age was 68.5 years in men and 68.1 years in women). There were significant associations between the minor allele and higher median of BMI on dose dependent manner in men (p = 0.04 for trend in men and p = 0.10 for trend in women, respectively), and between the minor allele and overweight (>25 in BMI, OR 1.52, 95%CI 1.07 2.14, p=0.02 in men, OR 1.48, 95%CI 1.16 1.95, p=0.01 in women). Logistic regression analysis showed a significant protective association in men with carriers of minor allele against low bone mass after an adjustment for age and BMI (OR 0.63, 95%CI 0.44 0.90, p=0.01 in men, not significant in women). Conclusion: Our study indicated significant associations of the polymorphism on FTO with BMI and bone mass among community dwelling men. The polymorphism may play a rule in a part of bone health with higher BMI and other beneficial functions. References: [1]N Engl J Med. 2015; 373: 895-907 Disclosure of Interests: None declared"

In the meantime, historically postfracture osteoporosis medication use rates have been poor. Objectives: The aim is to analyze the management of osteoporosis in patients hospitalized for osteoporotic fractures (OF) at Nancy University Hospital (France) in 2017. Methods: Total number of hospitalized patients and hospital stays were extracted by the Department of Medical Information (DIM) which selected departments with at least forty hospitalizations with Medical Unit Summary related to a diagnosis of fracture or osteoporosis. Hospitalizations not concerned by a recent OF were excluded. Data on fractures, patient characteristics, risk factors for OF and fall, management of osteoporosis, discharge status, stay duration, were studied from patient medical records. Prevalence of OF stays, management of osteoporosis and factors associated with duration of stay were analyzed. Results: Out of a total of 153,840 hospitalizations, 918 hospitalizations (844 patients, mean age 74.5 years ± 13.6, 74.5% women) concern an OF. The prevalence of hospitalizations for OF was 0.6% of total hospitalizations and 17.9% of total hospitalizations for fractures. Among the 844 patients, 85.7% had a severe fracture (vertebral fracture: 56.2%, hip fracture: 24.1%), 16.5% had a non-severe fracture, and 8.5% had a fracture cascade in the year. At discharge from hospital, 11.7% of patients received a specific treatment for osteoporosis. Longer stay duration was associated with age, severe fractures, Groll index and discharge status. Conclusion: Nearly one hospitalized fracture in five is osteoporotic, while only one in ten patients is treated for osteoporosis. Stay duration increased with age and comorbidities. This encourages the development of early prevention, screening and treatment strategies for osteoporosis. References: [1]Hernlund E, Svedbom A, Ivergård M, Compston J, Cooper C, Stenmark J, et al.

Objectives: To investigate bone metabolic changes in postmenopausal women assuming lemon juice. Methods: Participants were postmenopausal osteoporotic women without history of clinical fractures who agreed to enrich their diet with lemon juice (Acti Lemon, Polenghi) over a 2-month period. The daily juice dose of 30 ml we suggested was equivalent to one Sicilian organic lemon. Surrogate markers of bone formation as procollagen type 1 N-propeptide (P1NP) and of bone resorption as C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), but also some regulators of bone metabolism as RANK-L, OPG, RANK-L/OPG ratio and sclerostin were assessed at baseline and then at 1 and 2 months after lemon juice administration. Controls were represented by a placebo group of age-matched osteoporotic postmenopausal women. Results: 47 participants [mean age 60.2 ± 4.1 yr.] completed the study, without reporting any adverse events. Lemon juice was well tolerated. Over the observation period modifications of bone metabolism occurred: we detected a decreased RANK-L/OPG ratio and increased CTX levels at all time points vs. baseline. Particularly, change at month-1 of sclerostin (versus baseline) has been positively associated with change at month-1 and month-2 of CTX (r=0.46, p=0.01 and r=0.43, p=0.01, respectively). Change at month-1 of OPG was positively associated with change at month-1 of P1NP (r=0.49, p=0.006). Change at month-1 of RANKL/OPG has been related with variation at day 30 of P1NP (r=-0.44, p=0.013). Variation of P1NP at month-1 was related with sclerostin variation at day 30 (r=-0.56, p=0.02) and month-2 vs. baseline value (r=0.44, p=0.017) and with sclerostin variation between month-1 and month-2 (r=0.69, p<0.001). Variation of P1NP between month-1 and month-2 was associated with RANKL change at month-1 (r=-0.35, p=0.05), with sclerostin change at month-1 (r=-0.49, p=0.008) and with sclerostin change between month-1 and month-2 (r=0.41, p=0.028). At a multiple regression analysis the change of P1NP between month-1 and month-2 was independently predicted by the change of sclerostin at month-1 (ß=-1.5, SE 0.5, p=0.006), after correcting for age, BMI and change of RANKL and CTX levels at month-1. No significant modifications raised from controls. Conclusion: Drinking lemon juice may boost bone metabolic changes involving both bone resorption and bone formation.

JOUR,SAT0461?SHORT-TERM MONITORING OF DENOSUMAB EFFECT IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVING AROMATASE INHIBITORS USING REMS TECHNOLOGY ON LUMBAR SPINE,"['Quarta, E.', 'Ciardo, D.', 'Ciccarese, M.', 'Conversano, F.', 'DI Paola, M.', 'Forcignanò, R.', 'Grimaldi, A.', 'Lombardi, F.A.', 'Muratore, M.', 'Pisani, P.', 'Casciaro, S.']",2020,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2020-eular.3806,"Background: Aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy in women with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer (BC) causes accelerated bone loss and increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures as side effects. Denosumab (i.e. 60 mg twice a year) is a viable therapy against bone resorption, but the short-term monitoring of bone mineral density (BMD) change with time is still an unmet clinical need, since the current techniques (including dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, DXA) require 1-2 years between two consecutive measurements [1]. Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS), with high performance in terms of precision and repeatability [2], might be used in this setting of patients for short-term monitoring of bone health-related parameters. Objectives: The objective is the short-term monitoring of the effect of AIs with/without denosumab on bone health in BC patients using REMS and DXA scans at lumbar spine. Methods: Post-menopausal ER+ BC patients treated with adjuvant AIs were recruited. Two subgroups were identified, whether receiving also 60 mg of denosumab therapy every 6 months or not (named Group A and Group B, respectively). All patients underwent baseline DXA and REMS lumbar spine scans at time T0, previous to the first AI therapy, and after 12 months (time T1). REMS scan only was repeated also at 18 months (T2), since a 6-month interval between two consecutive scans is not recommended for DXA. The bone mineral density (BMD) was measured with both techniques. Results: Overall, 254 ER+ BC patients were enrolled (127 per group). The effect of denosumab on BMD is reported in Table. The BMD values obtained by DXA and REMS were not significantly different at T0 and T1, whereas the difference between Group A and B at T1 was statistically significant (p<0.001) both for REMS and DXA. At T2, REMS confirmed the increasing trend of BMD for Group A and the decreasing one for Group B, and the difference between groups was statistically significant (p<0.001). For each time point and each group, there were not statistically significant differences between DXA and REMS. Conclusion: Several studies have shown the effect of denosumab on BMD over a period not less than 2 years from the start of treatment. This study showed the feasibility of short-term follow-up using REMS lumbar spine scans at 6-month time steps.

However, few long-term studies describe the independent association of these structural factors and total knee replacement (TKR) in older adults. Objectives: To describe whether cartilage defects, bone marrow lesions (BMLs), effusion-synovitis, and meniscal pathologies at baseline are associated with TKR over 13 years and to estimate the additive effect of these measures for risk prediction of TKR. Methods: 1082 participants (mean age 62.8 years, 50% female) were randomly recruited from Tasmania and followed over 13.3 years. A 1.5T MRI scan of the right knee was acquired at baseline (n=930). Cartilage defects (grade 0-4), BMLs (grade 0-3), effusion-synovitis (grade 0-3), meniscal tears (grade 0-3) and meniscal extrusion (grade 0-2) was scored at baseline using T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI. WOMAC knee pain was recorded from questionnaires and radiographic OA (ROA) was assessed by OARSI scale. The incidence of primary (first-time) TKR was determined by data linkage to the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR). Log binomial regression were used to estimate the risk of TKR associated with baseline MRI measures, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, ROA, and pain. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were used and area under the curves (AUCs) were compared. Results: After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and ROA status, baseline cartilage defects (grade 2, RR=6.71; grade 3, RR=11.17; grade 4, RR=13.2; all p<0.01) were consistently and significantly associated with TKR over 13 years. These associations remained significant after further adjustment for other MRI pathologies. BMLs (grade 1, RR=2.74; grade 2, RR=2.64; grade 3 RR=4.01, all p<0.05 except grade 2), grade 3 effusion-synovitis (RR=2.74, p<0.05) and suprapatellar effusion-synovitis area were associated with TKR over 13 years. However, these associations of BMLs and effusion-synovitis with TKR were largely dependent on cartilage defects. Those who had TKR all had a meniscal tear at baseline, with 96% of them having a grade 3 tear. Compared to the baseline model with age, sex and BMI (area under the ROC curve [AUC = 0.62]), Model 1 with the addition of ROA and WOMAC pain performed better (AUC =0.77). Addition of cartilage defects to Model 1 resulted in a significant increase of AUC to 0.84. However, addition of BMLs and effusion-synovitis to the model 1 resulted in a nonsignificant small increase in AUC (0.78 and 0.76) only. The combination of all MRI pathologies to Model 1 resulted in a significant increase of AUC to 0.82. Conclusion: Baseline knee MRI structural pathology markers can predict TKR over the long-term, suggesting that MRI structural markers are good predictors of rapid knee OA progression in the general population. Semiquantitative MRI measures such as cartilage defects significantly improve the model performance for prediction of TKR over 13 years, and hence could be utilized in prediction/decision making of TKR.

Rheumatologists quite oftenly face with these patients which is termed as inflammation of unknown origin (UIO). Differential diagnosis of UIO is diverse and investigation of such cases are challenging and time consuming. Objectives: to assess diagnostic utility of PET CT in the diagnosis of patients with UIO Methods Study comprised 68 (36 male, mean age 58.7±14.8, range 19-87 years) adult IUO subjects without a previous diagnosis of an inflammatory or malignant disease. Patients were screened with PET CT after 8 hours fasting, if a specific diagnosis could not be established with comprehensive evaluation including; meticulous history and physical examination, pertinent microbiologic cultures, brucella agglutination, Mantoux test, serum protein electrophoresis, echocardiography, plain x-rays, computed tomography of thorax and abdomen/pelvis. Results Final diagnosis were established in follow up were inflammatory diseases in 37 (54.4%), malignant disorders in 16 (23.5%) and infections in 5 (7.4%), whereas a final diagnosis cannot be made in 10 (14.7%). PET CT aided diagnosis in 40 (58.8%) patients but was ineffective in 28 (41.2%). All three PET CT positive subjects with a final diagnosis of infection had tuberculosis (tb). On of two PET negative subjects had EBV and one other also had tb. PET CT was positive in 24 of 37 (64.9%) subjects with a final diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic disease. Final inflammatory diseases were large vessel vasculitis 15, polymyalgia rheumatica 5, seronegative arthritis 4, and other rare miscellaneous diseases, such as small vessel vasculitis, inflammatory myositis, polychondritis, sarcoidosis and IgG4 related disease. PET was positive in 11 of 15 (73.3%) large vessel vasculitis patients and 2 of 5 (40%) PMR patients. Because of small number of miscellaneous rheumatic diseases, diagnostic value of PET cannot be evaluated in these. Conclusion Investigation of underlying etiology of UIO is time and effort consuming. PET CT may help to identify final diagnosis more quickly by directing an obscure inflammatory site. PET CT may also have advantages like reducing number of unnecessary biopsies, diagnostic time, anxiety, work loss, morbidity and mortality References [1] Kan Y, Wang W, Liu J, Yang J, Wang Z.

Moreover, a common condition represented by osteoarthritis, by modifying the joint soft tissues composition, can alter the values of BMD [2]. In patients affected by discarthrosis, in fact, osteoporotic T-score values at femoral neck (FN) can be associated with normal or osteopenic T-score values of the lumbar spine (LS), the latter influenced by the presence of osteophytes and/or subchondral bone sclerosis. Objectives: To evaluate the predictive value of an innoative densitometric technique, the Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS) [3], in detecting bone fragility in patients affected by osteoarthitis. Methods: The T-score values of 35 postmenopausal women with clinical and/or radiological signs of osteoarthritis (mean age 71 years, average BMI 24,2) obtained by DXA at lumbar spine and femoral neck were compared with those obtained by REMS technique performed in the same anatomical sites. Results: In all the subjects, LS T-score resulted significantly higher than the FN one according to DXA measurement. However, REMS outcomes in both the sites were significantly lower than the corresponding DXA measurement (significant difference between DXA and REMS T-score for both LS (p = 0.006) and FN (p = 0.010), and spinal REMS T-scores resulted more similar to femural REMS (average REMS T-score LS: -2.6 ± 1,6 vs T-score FN: -2.4 ± 0, 6) and to femural DXA values. Conclusion: These preliminary data suggest that REMS technique, which has been shown to have high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy when compared with DXA in diagnosing and monitoring osteoporosis [3], is not affected by the presence of alterated soft tissues composition. it would therefore be particularly useful for the evaluation of bone fragility in subjects at risk of osteoarthritis.

However, few studies address the agreement between the US with the clinical examination in patients with early arthritis. Objectives: To evaluate the agreement between clinical examination and US findings of metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of patients with early arthritis Methods: Patients from the EAC of our department with suspect arthralgia were included. Patients were submitted to clinical evaluation by a rheumatologist to identify tender and swollen joints. They were then submitted to an US examination of metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, by an experienced sonographer oblivious of the previous examination. Each joint was scored for the presence of synovial hypertrophy (SH) and Power Doppler (PD) signal. Based on OMERACT guidance, we defined synovitis as: ? grade 1 grey scale synovitis (hypoechoic SH regardless of the presence of effusion) and ? grade 1 power-Doppler. The diagnostic value of clinical evaluation was assessed through sensitivity, specificity, Negative predictive value (NPV) and Positive predictive value (PPV), assuming the US synovitis as gold standard. Clinical arthritis was defined by joint swelling. Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to analyse concordance between joint swelling appreciated by clinical exam and HS, PD and the presence of US synovitis. Kappa values < 0 were considered poor, 0-0.20 slight, 0.21-0.40 fair, 0.41-0.60 moderate, 0.61-0.80 good and 0.81-1.00 excellent.2 Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 21.0. Results: 77 consecutive patients were included (53.2% female) with a mean age of 53.8±19.1 years. We evaluated 770 MCP and 770 PIP joints. The sensitivity and specificity of clinical examination in relation to US synovitis was respectively 71% and 60% for MCP and 54.5% and 43.9% for PIP. The NPV and PPV for MCP were 87.8% and 33.3% respectively, and for PIP were 85.3% and 13.9%. The level of agreement between joint swelling and HS, PD and the presence of synovitis is show on Table 1. Conclusion: The clinical evaluation of MCP showed a better performance than clinical evaluation of PIP. The high NPV of clinical examination makes its suitable to be used to rule out MCP and PIP involvement in patients with early arthritis. The performance of the two assessment strategies on the same day may increase agreement and diagnostic certainty. References [1] - Colebatch AN, et al.

Methods The Belgian Bone Club (BBC) gathered a guideline developer group. Nine “Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome” (PICO) questions covering screening, diagnosis, non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments, and monitoring were formulated. A systematic search of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus was performed to find network meta-analyses, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, guidelines, and recommendations from scientific societies published in the last 10 years. Manual searches were also performed. Summaries of evidence were provided, and recommendations were further validated by the BBC board members and other national scientific societies’ experts. Results Of the 3840 references in the search, 333 full texts were assessed for eligibility, and 129 met the inclusion criteria. Osteoporosis screening using clinical risk factors should be considered. Patients with a recent (<2 years) major osteoporotic fracture were considered at very high and imminent risk of future fracture. The combination of bone mineral density measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and 10-year fracture risk was used to categorize patients as low or high risk. Patient education, the combination of weight-bearing and resistance training, and optimal calcium intake and vitamin D status were recommended. Antiresorptive and anabolic osteoporosis treatment should be considered for patients at high and very high fracture risk, respectively. Follow-up should focus on compliance, and patient-tailored monitoring should be considered. Conclusion BBC guidelines and 25 guideline recommendations bridge the gap between research and clinical practice for the screening, diagnosis, and management of osteoporosis."
JOUR,Utilizing QUS envelope statistics imaging to predict the risk of vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women,"['Wang, Chiao-Yin', 'Lin, Yu-Ching', 'Tang, Ya-Chun', 'Tsui, Po-Hsiang']",2026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultras.2025.107803,"This study aims to evaluate the clinical utility of quantitative ultrasound (QUS) envelope statistics imaging in predicting the risk of vertebral fractures (VFs) in postmenopausal women, compared to conventional dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements, including bone mineral density (BMD) and T-score. A total of 63 postmenopausal women were enrolled. QUS envelope statistics imaging was performed on the L3 vertebra, analyzing parameters including the Nakagami parameter (m), scatterer clustering parameter (?), coherent to diffuse signal ratio (k), and entropy (H) for comparisons with DXA. The data were divided into three tertiles: reference, early VF risk, and high-risk groups. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to evaluate the predictive abilities of each parameter for VF risk. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland-Altman plots were utilized to evaluate consistency both within subjects and across different operators. There were no significant differences in QUS parameters between subjects with and without VFs overall (p > 0.05). However, compared to DXA, the Nakagami parameter and entropy demonstrated a significant association with early VF risk, as subjects in the second tertile exhibited higher risks of VFs compared to those in the first tertile (ORs: 3.02 for m and 3.30 for H). Bland-Altman analysis indicated mean differences close to zero and ICCs exceeding 0.90 for all QUS parameters. QUS envelope statistics imaging could complement DXA in predicting VFs, particularly in detecting early fracture risk, offering a non-invasive, radiation-free alternative for osteoporosis screening."
