In particular, REMS has been shown to measure bone mineral density (BMD) at axial skeletal bones with a precision, repeatability and accuracy not inferior to those of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Moreover, REMS may be useful in the assessment of impaired bone quality and to predict fragility fracture risk. Due to these characteristics, REMS could be usefully used in the diagnosis and follow up of osteoporosis in rare bone diseases. The clinical cases includes in this study were selected among those that best highlight the strengths of REMS technology. A recent study conducted on subjects affected by osteogenesis imperfecta has demonstrated that the REMS technique is able to assess BMD in the same way as the DXA evaluation. REMS has also demonstrated excellent diagnostic accuracy in some patients suffering from others rare disease such as McCune-Albright or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. Furthermore, REMS could be particularly advantageous in children and in women of childbearing age or during pregnancy and breastfeeding. In conclusion, on the basis of these preliminary data, REMS can be usefulness for the evaluation and monitoring of bone in individuals with rare bone diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Radiofrequency echographic multi-spectrometry (REMS), a portable and radiation-free alternative, enables effective BMD evaluation in this vulnerable and underserved population. This cross-sectional study assessed BMD using REMS in 260 patients aged ? 70 years (39 males, 221 females; mean age 82.29 years) between April 2023 and July 2024. Osteoporosis diagnosis was based on T-scores < ? 2.5 SD or history of fragility fractures, with severe osteoporosis defined by WHO criteria and high fracture risk by lumbar T-scores < ? 3.3 SD. Care home patients had significantly lower BMD and T-scores than outpatients, with 56.3% diagnosed with severe osteoporosis and 71.8% exhibiting lumbar T-scores < ? 3.3 SD. Despite high fracture risks, only 12.7% of care home patients received treatment. These trends were consistent across all age groups, revealing a high prevalence and severity of osteoporosis in care home residents. REMS has unveiled a substantial treatment gap in this population, emphasizing the critical need for improved osteoporosis management and proactive interventions to reduce fracture risks among care home patients worldwide. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

However, the scientific literature is lacking with regard to the usefulness of REMS in BMD follow-up, especially the importance of the fragility score (FS). The main objective of this study was to determine whether FS follow-up is relevant in a group of patients with axial spondyloarthritis and whether REMS could have clinical applicability. Methods: Patients with a certain diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) were recruited from two medical healthcare centers and were scanned using Radiofrequency Echographic Multi-Spectrometry in order to obtain their fragility score (FS), an objective measurement of bone quality. The main group was randomized into a vitamin D supplementation branch and a non-supplementation branch and followed up every 6 months for 18 months in total. Comparisons between the branches were made using MiniTab v.20 statistical software. Results: Lower FS values were obtained in patients who initially had high scores, suggesting a positive impact of vitamin D on bone quality (p = 0.008). Muscle strength was evaluated through a visual analogue scale (VAS), with improvements being seen in the supplementation branch (p < 0.005). Furthermore, although some patients had experienced falls in previous years, during the study period, no new events were recorded in either group. Conclusions: The FS is a reliable tool for evaluating bone architecture and is useful in everyday practice for the management of patients taking vitamin D supplements. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS) is an innovative, non-ionizing imaging technique that recently emerged as a viable tool to diagnose osteoporosis and estimate the fragility fracture risk. Nevertheless, its clinical use is still limited due to its novelty and continuing uncertainty of long-term performance. Methods: In order to evaluate the accuracy of the REMS, a systematic review of the English-language literature was conducted. Three databases were searched for relevant publications from 1 January 2015 until 1 December 2024 using the keyword combinations “(radiofrequency echographic multi spectrometry OR REMS) AND (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry OR DXA)”. The initial search yielded 602 candidate articles. After screening the titles and abstracts following the eligibility criteria, 17 publications remained for full-text evaluation. Results: The reviewed studies demonstrated strong diagnostic agreement between REMS and DXA. Additionally, REMS showed enhanced diagnostic capabilities in cases where lumbar bone mineral density measurements by DXA were impaired by artifacts such as vertebral fractures, deformities, osteoarthritis, or vascular calcifications. REMS exhibited excellent intra-operator repeatability and precision, comparable to or exceeding the reported performance of DXA. The fragility score (FS), a parameter reflecting bone quality and structural integrity, effectively discriminated between fractured and non-fractured patients. Moreover, REMS proved to be a radiation-free option for bone health monitoring in radiation-sensitive populations or patients requiring frequent imaging to assess fracture risk. Conclusions: This current study underscores the robustness of REMS as a reliable method for diagnosing and monitoring osteoporosis and evaluating bone fragility via the FS. It also identifies critical knowledge gaps and emphasizes the need for further prospective studies to validate and expand the clinical applications of REMS across diverse patient populations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Ad-ditionally, the study aims to determine if comparing fracture risk using FRAX and the National Osteoporosis Guideline Group (NOGG) using the T-score from each method would lead to differences in a Brazilian female population. Subjects and methods: A sample of women aged 30-80 underwent REMS and DXA scans of axial sites at the Hospital São Paulo, Brazil. Subsequently, TBS was applied to DXA exams. Clinical data were obtained from hospital records and phone interviews to calculate fracture risk. Results: Among the 343 participants enrolled, 213 had comparable lumbar spine exams by REMS, DXA, and TBS, and 166 had comparable hip exams by REMS and DXA. The correlation between lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) by REMS and the TBS was low (r = 0.27, p < 0.001), as was the correlation between DXA and TBS (r = 0.39, p < 0.001). No statistically significant difference was found between the TBS classifications of osteoporotic lumbar spine by REMS and DXA (p = 0.178). Fracture risk data by FRAX were obtained from 119 participants, with 92% receiving concordant NOGG classifications for major osteo-porotic fracture risk from REMS and DXA (? = 0.71 CI95% (0.54 to 0.89), p < 0.001), and 87% for hip fracture risk (? = 0.58 CI95% (0.38 to 0.77), p < 0.001).

JOUR,"['Wojczakowski, W.', 'Futyma, K.']",Vitamin D and calcium levels related to bone mineral density during pregnancy and postpartum,2025,10.5603/gpl.102995,"Bone mineral density (BMD) is crucial for bone strength, with even a modest decrease significantly elevating fracture risk. Calcium imbalance during pregnancy contributes to BMD loss, as maternal stores are mobilized to support fetal skeletal development. Vitamin D deficiency exacerbates this issue, with prevalence rates alarming in various populations. Supplementation with vitamin D and calcium aims to mitigate BMD decline; however, optimal dosing and efficacy remain debated. Studies utilizing innovative diagnostic tools like radiofrequency echographic multi spectrometry (REMS) and quantitative ultrasonometry (QUS) shed light on BMD changes during pregnancy, offering safer alternatives to traditional methods such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), prohibited during pregnancy due to fetal radiation risks. Despite methodological challenges, research reveals significant BMD reductions during pregnancy, particularly in weight-bearing bones. In conclusion, maintaining maternal bone health during pregnancy and postpartum is critical, requiring comprehensive monitoring and support. Further research is needed to elucidate optimal strategies for preserving BMD throughout the reproductive lifespan, reducing fracture risk and enhancing maternal well-being. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Therefore, there is an urgent need for highly accurate and precise technologies capable of identifying osteoporosis earlier, thereby avoiding complications from fragility fractures. Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and precision of the non-ionizing technology Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS) for the diagnosis of osteoporosis in a male population in comparison with conventional Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). Methods: A cohort of 603 Caucasian males aged between 30 and 90 years were involved in the study. All the enrolled patients underwent lumbar and femoral scans with both DXA and REMS. The diagnostic agreement between REMS and DXA-measured BMD was expressed by Pearson correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman method. The accuracy of the diagnostic classification was evaluated by the assessment of sensitivity and specificity considering DXA as reference. Results: A significant correlation between REMS- and DXA-measured T-score values (r = 0.91, p < 0.0001) for lumbar spine and for femoral neck (r = 0.90, p < 0.0001) documented the substantial equivalence of the two measurement techniques. Bland-Altman outcomes showed that the average difference in T-score measurement is very close to zero (?0.06 ± 0.60 g/cm2 for lumbar spine and ? 0.07 ± 0.44 g/cm2 for femoral neck) confirming the agreement between the two techniques. Furthermore, REMS resulted an effective technique to discriminate osteoporotic patients from the non-osteoporotic ones on both lumbar spine (sensitivity = 90.1%, specificity = 93.6%) and femoral neck (sensitivity = 90.9%, specificity = 94.6%). Precision yielded RMS-CV = 0.40% for spine and RMS-CV = 0.34% for femur. Conclusion: REMS, is a reliable technology for the diagnosis of osteoporosis also in men.

This study aimed to investigate whether REMS technology can be used for densitometric evaluation of osteoporosis in patients with SMID with hip dislocation and severe scoliosis. Methods: Sixty-five patients with SMID, who resided in a long-term care facility and received comprehensive medical and rehabilitation care, underwent REMS scans of the femoral neck and/or lumbar spine. Data regarding anthropometric parameters (height and weight), bone mineral density (BMD), clinical diagnostic classification, physical ability, presence of scoliosis and hip dislocation, and frontal radiographs of both hip joints were obtained. Results: We included 29 men and 34 women (mean age: 52.6 years). All patients underwent successful scanning at either the femoral neck (82.5 %) or lumbar spine (95.2 %). BMD measurements obtained using REMS revealed low values, with a mean BMD, T-score, and Z-score of 0.67 g/cm2, ?2.39 standard deviation (SD), and ? 1.38 SD, respectively, at the femoral neck and 0.66 g/cm2, ?2.70 SD, and ? 1.87 SD, respectively, at the lumbar spine. The average Cobb angle of the lumbar spine was 34.0°; furthermore, dislocation rates did not significantly differ between those with and without successful BMD measurements (p = 0.073).

The association between T2DM and increased fracture risk has led to study the impact of new antidiabetic drugs on bone metabolism. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are incretin mimetic drugs which have many pleiotropic properties. The relationship between GLP-1RAs and bone is very complex: while in vitro and animal studies have demonstrated a protective effect on bone, human studies are scarce. We led a 12 months longitudinal study evaluating bone changes in 65 patients withT2DM for whom a therapy with GLP-1RAs had been planned. Fifty-four T2DM patients completed the 12-month study period; of them, 30 had been treated with weekly dulaglutide and 24 with weekly semaglutide. One-year therapy with GLP-1RAs resulted in a significant reduction in weight and BMI. Bone mineral density (BMD), bone metabolism, trabecular bone score (TBS), adiponectin, and myostatin were evaluated before and after 12 months of GLP-1RAs therapy. After 12 months of therapy bone turnover markers and adiponectin showed a significant increase, while myostatin values showed a modest but significant reduction. BMD-LS by DXA presented a significant reduction while the reduction in BMD-LS by REMS was not significant and TBS values showed a marginal increase. Both DXA and REMS techniques showed a modest but significant reduction in femoral BMD. In conclusion, the use of GLP-1RAs for 12 months preserves bone quality and reactivates bone turnover.

A cross-sectional study was conducted at Prof. Dr. Chairuddin P. Lubis Hospital of Universitas Sumatera Utara, Medan, Indonesia, from May 2023 to August 2023. Consecutive sampling method was employed to sample menopausal women with no history of hysterectomy or oophorectomy (unilateral or bilateral), and no history of hormone replacement therapy or vitamin D supplementation. Interviews and physical examinations were conducted to obtain the characteristics of the subjects (age, duration of menopause, and body mass index). The 25(OH)D level was measured using immunoassay and REMS examination was conducted to assess BMD.

The hallmark features of OI include bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures, bone deformity, and diminished growth, along with a plethora of associated secondary features (both skeletal and extraskeletal). The diagnosis of OI is currently made on clinical grounds and may be confirmed by genetic testing. However, imaging remains pivotal in the evaluation of this disease. The aim of this article is to review the current role played by the various radiologic techniques in the diagnosis and monitoring of OI in the postnatal setting as well as to discuss recent advances and future perspectives in OI imaging. Conventional Radiography and Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) are currently the two most used imaging modalities in OI. The cardinal radiographic features of OI include generalized osteopenia/osteoporosis, bone deformities, and fractures. DXA is currently the most available technique to assess Bone Mineral Density (BMD), specifically areal BMD (aBMD). However, DXA has important limitations and cannot fully characterize bone fragility in OI based on aBMD. Novel DXA-derived parameters, such as Trabecular Bone Score (TBS), may provide further insight into skeletal changes induced by OI, but evidence is still limited. Techniques like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can be useful as problem-solvers or in specific settings, including the evaluation of cranio-cervical abnormalities. Recent evidence supports the use of High-Resolution peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) as a promising tool to improve the characterization of bone fragility in OI. However, HR-pQCT remains a primarily research technique at present. Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) is an alternative to DXA for the determination of BMD at central sites, with distinct advantages but considerably higher radiation exposure. Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) is a portable, inexpensive, and radiation-free modality that may complement DXA evaluation, providing information on bone quality. However, evidence of usefulness of QUS in OI is poor. Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS) is an emerging non-ionizing imaging method that holds promise for the diagnosis of low BMD and for the prediction of fracture risk, but so far only one published study has investigated its role in OI. To conclude, several different radiologic techniques have proven to be effective in the diagnosis and monitoring of OI, each with their own specificities and peculiarities. Clinicians should be aware of the strategic role of the various modalities in the different phases of the patient care process. In this scenario, the development of international guidelines including recommendations on the role of imaging in the diagnosis and monitoring of OI, accompanied by continuous active research in the field, could significantly improve the standardization of patient care. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS) is being recognized as an innovative diagnostic tool for assessing bone status. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the use of REMS may enhance the identification of osteoporosis in patients with osteoarthritis. Methods: A cohort of 500 patients (mean age: 63.9 ± 11.2 years) diagnosed with osteoarthritis and having a medical prescription for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were recruited for the study. All patients underwent BMD measurements at lumbar spine and femoral sites by both DXA and REMS techniques. Results: The T-score values for BMD at the lumbar spine (BMD-LS) by DXA were significantly higher with respect to BMD-LS by REMS across all OA severity scores, and the differences were more pronounced in patients with a higher degree of OA severity (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the percentage of subjects classified as “osteoporotic”, on the basis of BMD by REMS was markedly higher than those classified by DXA, both when considering all skeletal sites (39.4% vs. 15.1%, respectively) and the lumbar spine alone (30.5% vs. 6.0%, respectively). A similar pattern was observed when OA patients were grouped according to the Kellgren–Lawrence grading score. Conclusions: The findings from our study indicate that, in a population with varying severity levels of osteoarthritis, REMS demonstrated a higher capability to diagnose osteoporosis compared to DXA, and this could lead to earlier intervention and improved outcomes for patients with bone fragility, reducing the likelihood of fractures and associated complications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

We aimed to identify any discrepancies between measurements obtained using these instruments and identify the influencing factors. Methods: This cross-sectional study examined patients with osteoporosis treated at a single center from April to August 2023. We examined BMD assessment by DXA and REMS in lumbar spine and proximal femur. Patients were categorized into two groups: those with discrepancies between lumbar spine BMD measured by DXA and REMS, and those without. Semiquantitative evaluation of vertebral fractures and abdominal aortic calcification scoring were also performed and compared between the two groups, along with various patient characteristics. Results: A total of 70 patients (88.6% female; mean age 78.39 ± 9.50 years) undergoing osteoporosis treatment were included in the study. A significant difference was noted between DXA and REMS measurement of BMD and T-scores, with REMS recording consistently lower values. The discrepancy group exhibited a higher incidence of multiple vertebral fractures and increased vascular calcification than the non-discrepancy group. Multivariate analysis indicated that diabetes mellitus, severe vertebral fractures, and increased abdominal aortic calcification scores were significantly associated with discrepancies in lumbar spine T-scores. Conclusion: This study suggests that REMS may offer a more accurate measurement of BMD, overcoming the overestimation of BMD by DXA owing to factors such as vertebral deformities, abdominal aortic calcification, and diabetes mellitus. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) is the most commonly used method for assessing bone mineral density (BMD). Today, particular attention is being directed towards new technologies, especially those that do not use radiation, for the early diagnosis of altered bone status. Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS) is a non-ionizing technology that evaluates the bone status at axial skeletal sites by analyzing raw ultrasound signals. In this review, we evaluated the data on the REMS technique present in the literature. The literature data confirmed diagnostic concordance between BMD values obtained using DXA and REMS. Furthermore, REMS has adequate precision and repeatability characteristics, is able to predict the risk of fragility fractures, and may be able to overcome some of the limitations of DXA. In conclusion, REMS could become the method of choice for the assessment of bone status in children, in women of childbearing age or who are pregnant, and in several secondary osteoporosis conditions due to its good precision and replicability, its transportability, and the absence of ionizing radiation.

The novel Fragility Score (FS) parameter, obtained during a Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS) scan of lumbar or femoral regions, has been developed for the non-ionizing estimation of skeletal fragility. Aims: The aim of this study was to assess the performance of FS in the early identification of patients at risk for incident fragility fractures with respect to bone mineral density (BMD) measurements. Methods: Data from 1989 Caucasians of both genders were analysed and the incidence of fractures was assessed during a follow-up period up to 5 years. The diagnostic performance of FS to discriminate between patients with and without incident fragility fracture in comparison to that of the BMD T-scores measured by both Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and REMS was assessed through ROC analysis. Results: Concerning the prediction of generic osteoporotic fractures, FS provided AUC = 0.811 for women and AUC = 0.780 for men, which resulted in AUC = 0.715 and AUC = 0.758, respectively, when adjusted for age and body mass index (BMI). For the prediction of hip fractures, the corresponding values were AUC = 0.780 for women and AUC = 0.809 for men, which became AUC = 0.735 and AUC = 0.758, respectively, after age- and BMI-adjustment. Overall, FS showed the highest prediction ability for any considered fracture type in both genders, resulting always being significantly higher than either T-scores, whose AUC values were in the range 0.472–0.709.

A rare secondary form is pregnancy-associated osteoporosis. The standard method for determining bone density is DEXA measurement (dual X-ray absorptiometry). With the radiofrequency echographic multi spectrometry (REMS) method this is done using ultrasound without radiation exposure. Osteoporosis often leads to pathological fractures of the vertebrae. In case of severe pain and immobilization vertebroplasty is considered standard procedure. However, it can have side effects such as cement leakage into surrounding tissue, pulmonary embolism and adjacent fractures. We present a 27-year-old female patient with compression fractures of the Th8 and Th12 5 months after labor. DEXA measurements showed values of the T-score at hip neck -2.5 SD (total) and -3.5 SD (L1-L4) at spine. The fractures of the Th8 and Th12 were then treated with vertebroplasty. A post-operative CT showed cement leakage and extravasation, as well as bilateral cement embolism of the proximal branches of the pulmonary arteries and progression of the height loss of Th5, Th7 and L1. Pulmonary cement embolism is a rare complication of vertebroplasty. Cement leakage is more frequent complication, although most of the time asymptomatic. These risks of complications make the alternative conservative treatment worth considering before proceeding to surgical interventions. Only after failure to achieve adequate pain management kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty should be considered, due to the risks of prolonged immobilization of the patient leading to further bone and muscle loss. Pregnancy associated osteoporosis is very rare. The radiation free REMS method is suitable for pregnant women. Vertebroplasty offers pain relief and rapid mobilization of the patient. However, it poses a risk of numerous complications. The osteoporotic fractures of the vertebrae are usually stable and a conservative treatment prior to surgical interventions should always be considered. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS), a new diagnostic technology using an ultrasound approach, has been recognized by scientific associations as a facilitator of patients’ care pathway. We aimed at evaluating the costs of REMS vs. the conventional ionizing technology (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, DXA) for the diagnosis of osteoporosis from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (NHS) using a cost-minimization analysis (CMA). Methods: We carried out structured qualitative interviews and a structured expert elicitation exercise to estimate healthcare resource consumption with a purposeful sample of clinical experts. For the elicitation exercise, an Excel tool was developed and, for each parameter, experts were asked to provide the lowest, highest and most likely value. Estimates provided by experts were averaged with equal weights. Unit costs were retrieved using different public sources. Results: Considering the base-case scenario (most likely value), the cost of professionals amounts to €31.9 for REMS and €48.8 for DXA, the cost of instrumental examinations and laboratory tests to €45.1 for REMS and €68.2 for DXA. Overall, in terms of current costs, REMS is associated with a mean saving for the NHS of €40.0 (range: €27.6-71.5) for each patient. Conclusions: REMS is associated with lower direct healthcare costs with respect to DXA. These results may inform policy-makers on the value of the REMS technology in the earlier diagnosis for osteoporosis, and support their decision regarding the reimbursement and diffusion of the technology in the Italian NHS. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Methods: Consecutive patients referring to the PD clinic of our hospital were included. Lumbar spine and femur scans were acquired with both techniques (including lumbar laterolateral DXA scans). The risk assessment of two fracture risk algorithms (FRAX® and DeFRA®) were compared. Cohen’s k coefficients were used to assess the inter-technique agreement in the classification of patients as osteoporotic. Lumbar AOCs were estimated semi-quantitatively on laterolateral DXA scans. Results: 41 patients were enrolled. No significant differences were documented between the BMD T-scores measured through DXA or REMS at the femur. At the lumbar spine, the DXA anteroposterior mean T-score (? 0.49 ± 1.98) was significantly higher than both the laterolateral DXA (? 1.66 ± 0.99) and the REMS (? 2.00 ± 1.94) measurements (p < 0.01 vs both). No significant differences were found between the DXA and REMS fracture risk estimates with both algorithms. The inter-technique Cohen’s k coefficient (for the worst T-score, any site) was 0.421, p < 0.001.

Methods: In a cohort of 50 subjects with restrictive AN and in 30 healthy controls, we measured BMD at the lumbar spine (LS-BMD), at femoral neck (FN-BMD) and total hip (TH-BMD) using both DXA and REMS technique. Results: BMD evaluated by DXA and REMS technique at all measurement sites were all significantly (p < 0.01) lower in subjects suffering from AN subjects than in controls. Good correlations were detected between BMD by DXA and BMD by REMS measurements at LS (r = 0.64, p < 0.01) at FN (r = 0.86, p < 0.01) and at TH (r = 0.84, p < 0.01) in subjects suffering from AN. Moreover, Bland–Altman analysis confirmed the good agreement between the two techniques. The subjects suffering from AN with previous vertebral fragility fractures presented lower values of both BMD-LS and BMD-TH by DXA and by REMS with respect to those without fractures; however, the difference was significant only for BMD-TH by REMS (p < 0.05).

Recently, a new approach for osteoporosis diagnosis, defined as radiofrequency echographic multi-spectrometry (REMS), represents an innovative diagnostic tool that seems to be able to investigate bone quality and provide an estimation of fracture risk independent of BMD. The aim of this paper was to evaluate whether the use of REMS technology can favor the diagnosis of osteoporosis in subjects with an apparent increase in BMD. Methods: In a cohort of 159 postmenopausal (66.2 ± 11.6 yrs) women with overestimated BMD by DXA at the lumbar spine, we performed an echographic scan with the REMS technique. Results: The mean values of BMD at different skeletal sites obtained by the DXA and REMS techniques showed that the BMD T-scores by REMS were significantly lower than those obtained by the DXA technique both at the lumbar spine (p < 0.01) and at all femoral subregions (p < 0.05). In OA subjects, the percentage of women classified as “osteoporotic” on the basis of BMD by REMS was markedly higher with respect to those classified by DXA (35.1% vs 9.3%, respectively). Similarly, the REMS allows a greater number of fractured patients to be classified as osteoporotic than DXA (58.7% vs 23.3%, respectively).

Along with a review of the main in-vivo imaging approaches for skeletal robustness evaluation and fracture risk assessment, further understanding into Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS), an ultrasound-based method measuring clinically relevant bone districts (i.e. lumbar vertebrae and proximal femur), is provided, and the further potentialities of this technology are discussed. Currently, the bone mineral density (BMD) provided by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is considered an established indicator for osteoporosis status assessment and fracture risk prediction, however, in order to obtain more accurate results, an additional step beyond BMD would be necessary, which means including data on bone quality for an improved evaluation of the disease and its consequences. REMS is a technology which allows both osteoporosis diagnosis, through the BMD estimation, and the prediction of fracture risk, through the computation of the Fragility Score; both measures are obtained by the automatic processing of unfiltered ultrasound signals acquired in correspondence of anatomical reference sites. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

It is performed in a variety of skeletal sites, among which the most widely investigated and clinically used are first the calcaneus and then the radius. Nevertheless, there is still uncertainty in the incorporation of QUS in the clinical management of osteoporosis as the level of clinical validation differs substantially upon the QUS models available. In fact, results from a given QUS device can unlikely be extrapolated to another one, given the technological differences between QUS devices. The use of QUS in clinical routine to identify individuals at low or high risk of fracture could be considered primarily when central DXA is not easily available. In this later case, it is recommended that QUS bone parameters are used in combination with established clinical risk factors for fracture. Currently, stand-alone QUS is not recommended for treatment initiation decision making or follow-up. As WHO classification of osteoporosis thresholds cannot apply to QUS, thresholds specific for given QUS devices and parameters need to be determined and cross-validated widely to have a well-defined and certain use of QUS in osteoporosis clinical workflow. Despite the acknowledged current clinical limitations for QUS to be used more widely in daily routine, substantial progresses have been made and new results are promising. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Aims: This study aimed to evaluate whether the use of the Radiofrequency Echographic multi spectrometry (REMS) technique may improve the identification of osteoporosis in T2DM patients. Methods: In a cohort of 90 consecutive postmenopausal elderly (70.5 ± 7.6 years) women with T2DM and in 90 healthy controls we measured BMD at the lumbar spine (LS-BMD), at femoral neck (FN-BMD) and total hip (TH-BMD) using a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry device; moreover, REMS scans were also carried out at the same axial sites. Results: DXA measurements were all higher in T2DM than in non-T2DM women; instead, all REMS measurements were lower in T2DM than in non T2DM women. Moreover, the percentage of T2DM women classified as “osteoporotic”, on the basis of BMD by REMS was markedly higher with respect to those classified by DXA (47.0% vs 28.0%, respectively). On the contrary, the percentage of T2DM women classified as osteopenic or normal by DXA was higher with respect to that by REMS (48.8% and 23.2% vs 38.6% and 14.5%, respectively). T2DM women with fragility fractures presented lower values of both BMD-LS by DXA and BMD-LS by REMS with respect to those without fractures; however, the difference was significant only for BMD-LS by REMS (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our data suggest that REMS technology may represent a useful approach to enhance the diagnosis of osteoporosis in patients with T2DM. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The use of radiofrequency echographic multispectrometry (REMS) as an alternative diagnostic tool might be of particular interest because this technique is nonionizing, the devices are portable, and their utilization relatively cheap. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to assess the agreement between a novel quantitative technique (REMS) and DXA in the evaluation of bone mineral density and diagnosis of osteoporosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS All recruited patients (n = 116) underwent DXA and REMS of the proximal femur and lumbar spine. The diagnostic agreement of REMS was assessed through a direct comparison with DXA results, with separate analysis for the proximal femur and lumbar spine scans. Additional sub-analysis of the impact of sex, age, and BMI was performed. RESULTS After the exclusion of patients due to significant skeletal impairments, missing results, and erroneous reports, 66 scans of the femur and 58 scans of the lumbar spine were analyzed. The diagnostic agreement between the results of DXA and REMS was 82.8% in the lumbar spine group and 84.8% in the femur group. Strong correlations between REMS and DXA results were found in both groups, regardless of the sex, age, and BMI. CONCLUSIONS Radiofrequency echographic multispectrometry showed a significant diagnostic agreement with the corresponding DXA measurements. The study further confirms the usefulness of REMS in the assessment of osteoporosis. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

It has already been validated in Italian women with respect to the current clinical reference technology, Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). Purpose: Aim of the current study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of REMS technology with respect to DXA in a wider European clinical context. Methods: A total of 4307 female Caucasian patients aged between 30 and 90 years underwent DXA and REMS scans at femoral neck and/or lumbar spine (the site depending on the medical prescription). The acquired data underwent a rigorous quality check in order to exclude the erroneous DXA and REMS reports. The diagnostic agreement between the two technologies was assessed, also stratifying for patients' age groups. The ability to recognise previously fractured patients was also investigated. Results: Overall, 4245 lumbar spine scans and 4271 femoral neck scans were performed. The ability to discriminate patients with and without osteoporosis by femoral neck investigation resulted in sensitivity and specificity of 90.4% and 95.5%, respectively. For lumbar spine scans, a sensitivity of 90.9% and a specificity of 95.1% were obtained. The areas under the curve (AUCs) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve evaluating the ability to discriminate groups of patients with previous osteoporotic fracture using DXA and REMS T-score values were 0.631 and 0.683 (p < 0.0001), respectively, for femoral neck scans, whereas 0.603 and 0.640 (p = 0.0002), respectively, for lumbar spine scans.

The aim of our study was to compare bone mineral density (BMD) in acromegaly patients and healthy controls by performing novel REMS densitometry. The second objective was to analyse the correlation between results of REMS and classical dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in acromegaly patients. Material and methods: We enrolled 33 patients with acromegaly (AG) and 24 controls (CG). The acromegaly patients were divided into two subgroups: well-controlled acromegaly (WCA) and surgery-cured acromegaly (SCA). REMS was performed in all participants, while DXA was performed only in the acromegaly group. IGF-I and GH levels were measured in acromegaly patients. Results: Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (LS) and the femoral neck (FN) obtained from REMS did not reveal significant differences between AG, CG, WCA, and SCA. Similarly, there were no significant differences in BMD measured by DXA at the LS and at the FN between WCA and SCA. Significant positive correlations between IGF-I concentrations and BMD obtained from both REMS and DXA were detected in the AG and WCA. In the AG and WCA, there were positive correlations between T-scores and LS BMD obtained from both methods. Conclusions: Radiofrequency echographic multi-spectrometry is a potential method in assessment of bone status in acromegaly. Further studies with participation of active disease patients are needed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Methods: A population of Caucasian women (30–90 years), enrolled from 2013 to 2016, underwent dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and REMS scans at axial sites. The incidence of fragility fractures was assessed during a follow-up period up to 5 years. Afterwards, patients with and without incident fractures were stratified in two age-matched groups with a 1: 2 proportion (Group F’ and Group NF’, respectively). The performance of REMS T-score in discriminating between the two groups was quantitatively assessed and compared with DXA. Results: 1516 patients were enrolled and 1370 completed the follow-up (mean ± SD: 3.7 ± 0.8 years; range: 1.9–5.0 years). Fracture incidence was 14.0%. Age-matched groups included 175 fractured patients and 350 non-fractured ones, respectively (median age 70.2 [interquartile range: 61.0–73.3] and 67.3 [65.4–69.8] years, p-value ns). The groups resulted also balanced for height, weight and BMI (p-values ns). As expected, the differences in REMS T-score (for vertebral site, ?2.9 [?3.6 to ?1.9] in Group F’, ?2.2 [?2.9 to ?1.2] in Group NF’) and DXA T-score (?2.8 [?3.3 to ?1.9] in Group F’, ?2.2 [?2.9 to ?1.4] in Group NF’) were statistically significant (p-value <0.001). Analogous results were obtained for femoral neck. Considering the T-score cut-off of ?2.5, REMS identified Group F’ patients with a sensitivity of 65.1% and specificity of 57.7% of (OR = 2.6, 95%CI: 1.77–3.76, p < 0.001), whereas DXA showed a sensitivity of 57.1% and a specificity of 56.3% (OR = 1.7, 95%CI: 1.20–2.51, p-value = 0.0032). For femoral neck, REMS sensitivity and specificity were 40.2% and 79.9%, respectively, with an OR of 2.81 (95%CI: 1.80–4.39, p < 0.001). DXA, instead, showed a sensitivity and specificity of 42.3% and 79.3%, respectively, with an OR of 2.68 (95%CI: 1.71–4.21, p < 0.001).

Methods: A working group convened by the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis met to review the current image-based methods for bone strength assessment and fracture risk estimation, and to discuss the clinical perspectives of REMS. Results: Areal bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the consolidated indicator for osteoporosis diagnosis and fracture risk assessment. A more reliable fracture risk estimation would actually require an improved assessment of bone strength, integrating also bone quality information. Several different approaches have been proposed, including additional DXA-based parameters, quantitative computed tomography, and quantitative ultrasound. Although each of them showed a somewhat improved clinical performance, none satisfied all the requirements for a widespread routine employment, which was typically hindered by unclear clinical usefulness, radiation doses, limited accessibility, or inapplicability to spine and hip, therefore leaving several clinical needs still unmet. REMS is a clinically available technology for osteoporosis diagnosis and fracture risk assessment through the estimation of BMD on the axial skeleton reference sites. Its automatic processing of unfiltered ultrasound signals provides accurate BMD values in view of fracture risk assessment. Conclusions: New approaches for improved bone strength and fracture risk estimations are needed for a better management of osteoporotic patients. In this context, REMS represents a valuable approach for osteoporosis diagnosis and fracture risk prediction. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

An innovative echo-graphic approach for osteoporosis diagnosis, directly applicable on both femoral neck and lumbar spine, has been recently introduced and clinically validated through single-center and multicenter studies. This developed approach has been subsequently defined as Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS). REMS technology arouses the interest of clinicians not only for its characteristics, such as simplicity and repeatability, transportability and absence of ionizing radiation, but also because it can provide information on bone tissue characteristics (elasticity, microstructure) different from the BMD measured by DEXA. Moreover, this technique could also be used in the diagnosis of different metabolic bone diseases, in patients with corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis, in diabetics, or in women treated with aromatase inhibitors, conditions in which the assessment of BMD underestimates the fracture risk. Furthermore, the absence of ionizing radiation represents a valid possibility of using REMS echography to assess bone mineral status in children. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
